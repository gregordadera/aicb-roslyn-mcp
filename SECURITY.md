# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately**, not as a public issue:

- Email **aicb@dadera.de** with a description and, if possible, a reproduction, or
- Use GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** (private security advisory) on the
  repository's *Security* tab.

You'll get an acknowledgment, and a fix or mitigation will be coordinated before
any public disclosure.

## Supported versions

Security fixes ship in a new public release; older versions do not get patch
releases. Update to the latest release to receive them (`dotnet tool update -g
aicb-roslyn-mcp`, or the newest installer). Up to version 0.5.465.1 the package
was called `AIContextBuilder`; an installation of that package is updated by
uninstalling it (`dotnet tool uninstall -g AIContextBuilder`) and installing
`aicb-roslyn-mcp`. A commercial agreement can define a
maintenance window for an older version.

## Threat model

`aicb` opens a C#/.NET solution with Roslyn and answers code-navigation questions
about it. The security-relevant question is therefore: **what does opening or
analyzing a solution actually execute?**

### What `aicb` does *not* do

- **The CLI and the MCP server never modify the code they analyze.** There are no
  refactoring or apply tools, and nothing any tool writes is anything Roslyn reads.
  What they *do* write is named in each tool's own description:
  `apply_solution_config` writes a `<Solution>.aicb.json` sidecar next to the `.sln`,
  `install_agent_hooks` installs the symbol guard (and, for Claude Code, a
  SessionStart hook that keeps the aicb skill files in step) into your agent
  harness's configuration on request, and `export_markdown` writes the file you
  point `outputPath` at. The server itself writes one kind of file without a tool
  call asking for it: after its first session it rewrites the aicb skill files of
  the project it was started in, and only files that carry the aicb marker - it
  creates and deletes none, and a switch in the main settings (automatic skill
  sync) turns it off. **The desktop app is the deliberate exception:** its Details tab
  is an editor, and a file you change there is written back when you press Save.
- **It does not run your solution's third-party Roslyn analyzers unless you ask
  for one kind of them.** `get_diagnostics` returns **compiler** diagnostics only:
  it calls `Compilation.GetDiagnostics()`, which by Roslyn's design does not invoke
  `DiagnosticAnalyzer`s. Diagnostics that a source generator reports itself are not
  included either. To tell where a real build would suppress some of those
  diagnostics, it reads the analyzer assemblies' **metadata** only, which runs none
  of their code. The one exception is the opt-in argument `runSuppressors: true`:
  it loads exactly the analyzer assemblies that declare a `DiagnosticSuppressor`
  and runs those suppressors through `CompilationWithAnalyzers`, as a real build
  does. Loading such an assembly creates every analyzer type it declares, so their
  constructors run too. That code then runs inside the `aicb` process, in the same
  trust boundary as the source generators below. Nothing else calls
  `CompilationWithAnalyzers` / `WithAnalyzers`.

### What `aicb` *does* run: your solution's source generators

When `aicb` builds a project's compilation, Roslyn runs the source generators the
project references - generator packages, the .NET SDK's own generators and generator
projects in the solution - inside the `aicb` process, exactly as an IDE or
`dotnet build` does. This was measured on the published 0.5.464.56 with a test
generator that records the process it runs in. `aicb` does not index the generated
code itself: generated documents are not walked, and where it reports
source-generated members (e.g. `[ObservableProperty]` / `[RelayCommand]`), it
re-derives their names from the attributes in the parsed syntax. The one exception
is the C# the Razor generator compiles from a `.cshtml` view: it is read for what
the view uses, and every such use is credited to the view's own file. A generator whose
assembly is missing, for example an in-solution generator project that was never
built, cannot run; its generated code is then missing from the analysis.

A source generator is therefore part of the same trust boundary as the MSBuild
logic described below.

### What `aicb` starts as a process

`aicb` spawns three processes, none of which your code can steer. Measured over
every production method in the solution, `aicb` reaches `Process.Start` from
exactly three places, and each takes a fixed command line:

- **`vswhere.exe`** at startup, to find an MSBuild the locator does not know.
  Its argument line is a compile-time constant; nothing from your solution
  enters it.
- **`apicompat`**, only through the opt-in `compare_public_api` tool (not in the
  default pool). It takes **you**-supplied assembly paths - never paths derived
  from the analyzed solution - and compares assembly *metadata* rather than
  loading and running the assemblies.
- **`git rev-list`**, from `server_info`, to report how far this binary lags
  your checkout. **This one does use a solution-derived path** - as the child's
  *working directory*, so that the question is asked about your repository. The
  commit it names comes from this assembly's own build attribute and is rejected
  unless it is hexadecimal.

What makes the set safe is not the choice of programs but how they are invoked:
all three build their command lines through `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList` or a
constant, never through a shell, and never by concatenating a string. No file
name, namespace or symbol in your solution can therefore become an argument, a
flag, or a second command.

Scope note: this is the `aicb` CLI and MCP server. The WPF application ships
four further launch sites (opening the license file, the sponsor link, Explorer
on a selected solution, and a gallery-tool restart) - user-initiated shell
opens, outside this threat model.

### The one caveat you must know

> **Opening a solution runs its MSBuild build logic and its source generators -
> only analyze solutions you trust.**

To resolve references and determine what to compile, `aicb` loads projects through
`MSBuildWorkspace`, which performs MSBuild's **design-time build**. That evaluates
and runs the project's *own* MSBuild logic - its `.csproj`, `Directory.Build.props`
/ `.targets`, SDK and NuGet-restored imports, and any custom targets or inline
tasks (`UsingTask` / `Exec`). Building the compilation then runs the source
generators the projects reference (see above). A deliberately malicious project
could therefore run code at solution-open time.

This is **not specific to `aicb`.** It is inherent to every MSBuild-based tool - 
Visual Studio, the C# Dev Kit / C# language server, OmniSharp, and other
Roslyn/MSBuild analyzers all open projects the same way. The trust boundary is the
same as *"clone this repository and run `dotnet build`"* or *"open it in Visual
Studio"*: opening an untrusted project can execute code. `aicb` uses a plain
`MSBuildWorkspace` and neither reduces nor amplifies this baseline.

**Recommendation:** treat pointing `aicb` at a solution as equivalent to building
it. Only analyze solutions from sources you trust.
