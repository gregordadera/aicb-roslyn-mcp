# Changelog

Versions follow `Major.Minor.Series.Build`. The build number rises by one for every
change that lands, so gaps between published versions are normal - not every build is
released.

## 0.5.501.1 (2026-10-09) - `aicb init` sets up Codex and OpenCode, namespace exclusions keep what you name, and every answer about a session uses one layer profile

**Who is affected.** Everyone on the MCP server: reconnect your client once - 12 tools of the
default profile have a new description or a new parameter description; no tool or parameter was
added, removed or made required. Codex and OpenCode users: run `aicb init` again - it now
registers the server for these clients and writes the agent skill where they read it. Anyone
with a `.aicb.json`: it can now hold keep rules (`keepNamespaces`) and an explicit opt-out
(`exclusionsDisabled`); an earlier version ignores both. Anyone who analyzes without a
configuration database (`aicb analyze` without a session database, `aicb call` without
`--db-path`): the built-in namespace exclusion list now applies there too, so dependency lists
get shorter. Exported documents change in many places (below); the built-in MCP profiles'
template no longer embeds the source code of the whole solution. A snapshot, saved session or
remembered codebase from an earlier version is analyzed afresh the first time it is used. The
configuration database is updated the first time this version opens it (built-in tag schemas,
below). Desktop app users: automatic backup no longer delays the start, and the right-click
node-override editor is gone.

### Setting up Codex and OpenCode

- **`aicb init` registers the server for Codex and OpenCode**, which do not read `.mcp.json`:
  for each of them that the project uses, or that `--hooks` names, it writes the `aicb` entry
  into `.codex/config.toml` or `opencode.json` and writes the agent skill to `.agents/skills/`,
  where both read skills. Before, the server entry and the skill reached Claude Code only, and the
  run said so.
- `--hooks none` skips only the symbol guard; the server is still registered. To wire a client
  whose folder does not exist yet, name it: `aicb init --hooks codex` or `--hooks opencode`.
- Codex reads a project's `.codex/config.toml` only in a project you have trusted in Codex. The
  run ends with that sentence when it wrote the file.
- Your own `.codex/config.toml` is never rewritten: the entry is appended as a table of its own,
  and an `aicb` entry already there, in any TOML spelling, is kept.

### Namespace exclusions: keep rules, your own types, and the same list on every path

- **Keep rules.** A keep rule names a namespace the exclusion never drops - in `.aicb.json` under
  `"keepNamespaces"`, in the desktop app's exclusion list editor as the `Keep` column, and through
  `apply_solution_config` as `"keep": true` on an exclusion. Keep rules alone leave the built-in
  list in force beneath them, so a library whose subject is a framework area (for example Dapper
  and `System.Data`) needs one rule. Your own exclusion rules still replace the built-in list. A
  keep-only list for a solution applies over the app-wide list when one is set. An earlier
  version ignores `keepNamespaces` and drops it when it rewrites the file.
- **A type your solution declares is never dropped** because its namespace matches an exclusion
  rule: extension classes you declare in `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` and your own
  nullable value types (`CallOptions?`) reappear in dependency lists. This also holds when only a
  type argument of a base type or interface names your type (`Basket : OwnBase<OrderLine>`).
- **Without a configuration database the built-in list applies**: `aicb analyze` without a
  session database, `aicb call` without `--db-path` and a server without a configuration
  database now exclude `System`, `Microsoft`, `Windows`, `Syncfusion` and `CommunityToolkit`
  like every path with a database. Before, they excluded nothing, so one solution's dependency
  lists depended on whether a database existed.
- **The document names its list:** the header carries `Exclusions:` with the list, its source
  and its rule count (keep rules counted apart), and `export_markdown` with `outputPath` names it
  in its confirmation. With keep rules over the built-in list, the line names the built-in list
  that does the excluding.
- A type whose dependencies were all excluded no longer reads "without external dependencies";
  it reads "no dependency outside the excluded namespaces".
- **A nullable value type is judged by the type it wraps:** a kept or third-party `Kind?` is
  listed as `Kind?` in every dependency list, `int?` and other nullable built-in types no longer
  appear under a rule for `System`, and nullable framework types are excluded by their own
  namespace. The same holds for pointers.
- **`"exclusions": []` keeps its old meaning** - no list of your own, the built-in list applies -
  as in every `.aicb.json` an earlier version wrote. To exclude nothing, write
  `"exclusionsDisabled": true`; a file exported for a solution set to exclude nothing now carries
  it, and so does a list whose rules are all empty. A rule list with entries but no usable rule is
  reported as a broken file instead of being read as no list.
- **`check_solution_config_drift`** calls a custom test profile stale when it misses more than a
  quarter of the projects named like tests (before: 3 or more, whatever the solution's size),
  counts a multi-targeted project once, and an `ok` answer no longer says "may be stale". It
  judges a keep-only list by the list beneath it that does the excluding: over a list that
  excludes nothing it answers `not-configured`, over a keep-only app-wide list it judges the
  built-in list.

### `.aicb.json` is never rewritten from a file aicb could not read

- **`apply_solution_config` and the desktop app's `Export Config` leave a `.aicb.json` they cannot
  read exactly as it is** - malformed, locked, or holding a keep rule inside `exclusions` - and
  refuse before anything is written. Before, every setting the call did not name was deleted,
  `analyzePreferredTfmOnly` included. A file that becomes unreadable while the database is
  written is left alone too; the configuration is saved to the database and a warning says the
  file was not written.
- `apply_solution_config` keeps the layer, exclusion and test settings of the existing file for
  every setting the call does not change; before, a layer-only or test-only call dropped them.
- Keys a version does not know are written back unchanged, a keep rule written inside
  `exclusions` is moved to `keepNamespaces`, the test attribute names keep the file's spelling,
  and a `keep` flag that is not a JSON boolean is rejected.
- A written file contains no rule with an empty pattern or layer. Writing no longer fails when
  another writer writes the same file at that moment, leaves no `.tmp` file beside the solution,
  and removes such files an interrupted earlier write left.
- `aicb analyze` warns when the `.aicb.json` exists but could not be read.

### One layer profile for every answer about a session

- **Every render and every judgement about a session uses the same layer profile** - from
  `analyze_solution`'s `layerProfile`, the `.aicb.json`, or the configuration database the session
  was analyzed against: `architecture_overview` and the `living_architecture` resource (its layer
  map), `export_markdown` and the `session_markdown` resource, `get_context`, `explain_symbol`,
  `pack_for_task`, `prepare_task`, and without a `dbPath` also `list_insights`, `get_insight`,
  `solution_metrics`, `diff_review` and `evaluate_change_set`. Before, the renders used the
  built-in heuristic while `list_insights` judged layer violations under the configured profile,
  and the judging tools read the server's default database. The quality profile still comes from
  the server's default database.
- In `export_markdown`'s full document, the layer-violation entries of QUALITY_FINDINGS are
  judged under the document's own layer profile instead of the built-in Clean Architecture
  convention.
- A layer profile the session took from the configuration database is read again on every call,
  so editing or deleting it applies without a new analysis; a profile passed explicitly or taken
  from the `.aicb.json` stays as analyzed. The `layerProfile` a session answer names
  (`analyze_solution`, `refresh_session`, `list_sessions` and the other session answers) is the
  one the other answers apply.
- **The configuration database is read, never written, for this:** a locked, damaged or missing
  database no longer fails a render, and none is created. An app-wide default of "No mapping"
  counts as nothing configured, as it does for the analysis.
- **An answer says when that database could not be used** - locked, damaged, not an aicb
  database, or renamed or deleted since the analysis: a `configDbNote` member on a JSON answer, a
  `<!-- config-db: ... -->` comment on a Markdown answer (after a tag answer's frontmatter), and an
  extra content block on `list_insights` and the session resources. `list_sessions` names every
  session whose database cannot be read. When the layers fall back to the built-in convention
  because the `.aicb.json` cannot be used, the answer says why. A resource read no longer fails
  its size limit only because such a note was added.

### Exported documents

These apply to every Markdown output - `export_markdown`, `get_context`, `explain_symbol`,
`pack_for_task`, `prepare_task`, `aicb analyze` and the desktop app's export - unless a line names
fewer.

- **The built-in `AI Optimized` template, used by the built-in MCP profiles, no longer embeds the
  source code of the whole solution.** The new built-in template `AI Optimized + Source` keeps it.
  An existing configuration database picks this up unless you edited or hid the template.
- **Each line of code is printed once.** A `TYPE_CODE` or `METHOD_CODE` block is left out when its
  file's `FILE_CODE` block, or a type code block printed earlier in that file, already holds the
  code. Under the default profile a whole-solution export no longer prints code three times. A
  class picked with source while its file is not still gets its `TYPE_CODE`.
- **A template that embeds source** follows its MD profile's Source rule per kind, as the desktop
  app's tree already did: classes, records and plain structs keep their structure and lose only
  their own code block where the profile does not allow Source for classes.
- **Types carry `<SUMMARY>` and `<USED_BY>` blocks.** A class, interface, record, struct or enum
  with an XML `<summary>` now prints it, as methods always did, and a type lists the types that
  reference it by namespace-qualified name (in a slice, those the slice contains). Both were in
  the legend and never printed. Doc text whose elements stand on separate lines keeps a space
  between them.
- **Entry points:** `ENTRY_POINTS` and `ENTRY_POINT_FLOW` list a `private` or `internal`
  `static Main` of a valid entry-point shape, and a program written as top-level statements under
  its file label (`ConsoleApp/Program.cs (top-level) -> DR.RunAll()`).
- **Roles:** a class that derives from an ASP.NET controller through its own base classes gets
  the role `Controller` (and the layer `Presentation`), every class deriving from
  `System.Attribute` the role `Attribute`, and an attribute that implements an ASP.NET request
  filter interface the role `Middleware`; a filter-factory attribute stays `Attribute`. Methods of
  `Middleware` types appear as sources in `METHOD_GRAPH` and `METHOD_USED_BY_GRAPH`, and those that
  call into the project with a dependency, side effect or infrastructure use are listed as entry
  points. `find_by_semantics` follows the same roles.
- **Explicit interface implementations and accessors:** `USED_BY` names such a caller by its type
  and interface (`Order.IComparable.CompareTo(object)`, `Order.Total.get`) and lists every caller
  once; `METHOD_GRAPH` and `METHOD_USED_BY_GRAPH` include explicit implementations as callers. Two
  callers whose short labels would coincide print their qualified names. An expanded selection
  that follows callers keeps a property, indexer, event or constructor caller's type.
- **Parameter lists read the same on both sides of an edge:** in METHOD_GRAPH, METHOD_USED_BY,
  ENTRY_POINT_FLOW and the dependency lists a called method's parameter types are simple names
  (`Helper.Work(Payload)`), as on the calling side. Documents get shorter.
- **Dependency lists** name the types carried as type arguments of a type's member and base types
  at any depth (`List<OrderItem>` names `OrderItem`), keep a same-named type from another
  namespace and a non-generic type of the same name, and no longer list a tuple as a type or a
  generic type as its own dependency. A method's `Types:` list shows a tuple's element types
  instead of the tuple; a body using an array of tuples counts their element types.
- **Afferent coupling:** Ca counts references written inside a generic argument, an array or a
  nullable, and generic types are counted at all (they showed `n/a` or 0). Where several types
  share a simple name and a reference cannot be attributed, it is shown beside Ca, never in it: a
  type tag may carry `ca-ambiguous="N"`, QUALITY_HOTSPOTS prints `(+N ambiguous)`, and
  `solution_metrics` adds `caMaxNote` when the maximum could be higher.
- **Context sentences:** a method's `Context:` no longer claims purity: "Delegates work to other
  project methods." and "Self-contained: calls no other method." replace the two sentences that
  said "without side effects".
- **YAML:** exports that embed source keep their structure when a source file itself contains
  Markdown code fences (for example in a C# raw string) - before, the rest of the document could
  end up inside one text value. Embedded text reads back exactly, characters YAML cannot carry
  literally are escaped, and values and keys a YAML 1.1 reader would take for another type
  (`TRUE`, `ON`, `.inf`, a date, `<<`) are quoted. The `llm-natural-md` field format fences a value
  holding backticks with a longer fence.
- **The 8000-token floor is named:** a budget below it is raised as before, and the document's
  budget header, or the answer of `get_context`, `explain_symbol`, `pack_for_task` and
  `prepare_task`, now says `(requested 300, raised to the 8000 floor)`; on a YAML render as a
  `# budget: ...` comment.
- `export_markdown` treats a `format` that is neither `tag` nor `yaml` as omitted - the profile's
  format applies - and starts its answer with a note naming the ignored value. Before, any value
  rendered tag.

### MCP tool answers

- **`resolve_injection` names the registration a resolve receives:** a new field
  `effectiveRegistration` appears when two or more registrations match: the one a
  single-service resolve receives, read only where the order is certain within one
  straight-line registration method, else `winner: null` with the reason. Keyed registrations carry their `key`; two keys are two
  services, not `ambiguous`, and the three-argument `AddKeyed*(Type, key, Type)` and
  `AddSingleton(typeof(X))` forms are read.
- **References and callers:** a method with a `ref`, `in`, `out` or `ref readonly` parameter is
  listed with the modifier (`App.Parser.Read(ref int)`) by `find_usages`, `impact_of_change`,
  `call_graph` and `explain_symbol`, and an overload pair that differs only there is now two
  methods with their own callers, side effects and dead-code verdicts. A `calls_external` pattern
  with a parameter list spells an external by-ref parameter with its modifier
  (`TryParse(string, out int)`); a bare member name matches as before.
- `find_usages`, `impact_of_change`, `find_tests_for` and `coverage_gaps` credit the callers of an
  explicit interface implementation whose interface has a tuple type argument or is nested in a
  generic type. `find_usages` counts a caller in an explicit implementation or an accessor for
  the type that declares it (`selfReferences`, `textuallyInvisibleUsers`), and `explain_symbol`
  with `include: callers` lists such callers instead of answering `(none)`.
- **`impact_of_change`** says when a high-risk closure runs through a dependency cycle every
  symbol reaching it shares: a new `saturation` block names the cycle, and `risk` is then graded
  by the direct production users. `review_context` and `diff_review` carry the same risk.
- `get_type_hierarchy` and `find_implementations` count a tuple type argument as one argument
  (`Base<(int, int)>` is a reference to `Base<T>`).
- A type's accessibility comes from the compiler's view of the whole type: a `partial` type whose
  modifier is written on one part only, and a type without a modifier, are no longer reported as
  `private`, and `find_symbol` lists such a partial type once. A markup extension used in element
  form (`<local:Foo .../>`) counts as a reference to `FooExtension`, so `find_dead_code` no longer
  reports it dead.
- `solution_metrics` adds `debtApprox` beside `debtMinutes` (`"~29.7 d"`, 1 d = 8 h); both
  descriptions now say the minutes are a coarse estimate from fixed rules, not measured effort.
- `pack_for_task` and `prepare_task` no longer add same-named methods of other types (a second
  `Program.Main`) when the goal matched only one of them.
- `aicb import` and `import_constellation` refuse a file whose preview found a problem - a tag
  schema source outside the allowed list, an item without an id, an application-settings key that
  is not allowed or does not convert - with nothing written; before, the other items were written.
  An item that still fails at save time is named, and the warning says the rest stays written.

### Command line

- `aicb analyze` writes its document - directly, with `--emit-session-db` / `--session-db`, and
  with `--run-template` - under the layer profile its analysis and quality gate use, so the layer
  map matches the gate.
- `aicb call` records each call in the usage telemetry when it is given `--db-path`, under the
  client name `aicb-call`; `usage_report` counts it. It also prints the note about an unreadable
  configuration database, as the server's answers carry it.
- On Windows, when `APPDATA` is unset, empty or blank (some MCP clients start servers with a
  reduced environment), settings, the database, `aicb.mcp.json` and the logs resolve to your
  application-data folder instead of a relative `%APPDATA%` folder under the working directory.

### Desktop app

- **Automatic backup no longer delays the start.** It runs in the background once the main window
  is open and takes a consistent copy of the database while the app, and any `aicb mcp` server on
  the same database, keep working - a database another program had open was left out before
  (`-partial`). Other database files under the data folder are no longer packed into every
  backup, an interrupted backup no longer leaves a file that looks finished, and `Backup now` can
  run during an analysis. Automatic backup is on for new installations; existing ones keep their
  setting (Settings > Storage). A backup no longer shows as an active run in the Run Templates
  tab, and a database switch made during a backup waits for it instead of being undone.
- **The right-click node-override editor is removed** - the `Set Node Override...` menu entry, its
  dialog and the tree's red override dot. A right-click on a tree row opens nothing. The detail
  pill is unchanged.
- **Tag schemas you create reach the export:** picked in an MD profile's Class, Interface, Enum or
  Method row, or in the Sections panel, a schema becomes the first lines of every such block, and
  a copy of a built-in block replaces just that block. The SOLUTION, PROJECT and FILE header
  lines can be changed through their schemas. Settings > Tag Schemata says under each schema
  where it shows up, offers only source paths that produce output, flags a field whose path is
  no longer offered, and prints the declarations of class, interface and method fields readably.
  Twenty built-in schemas that never showed up in an export are gone; a profile or saved run that
  picked one shows the header schema that renders in its place.
- **The solution tree tells same-named members apart:** rows show type parameters, `ref` / `in` /
  `out`, the interface of an explicit implementation and a nested type's containing type, and a
  saved session reopens its selection and detail levels on the row they were made on. An entry of
  an earlier session that could belong to two such rows is listed as not found. Selecting one of
  two methods that differ only there exports that method alone.
- The selection strategies "Deep" and "Test-Coverage-Reachable" follow the types that reference
  a selected type.
- Changing a node's detail level changes the generated context at once; before, a level stored in
  the opened session could win until the app restarted.
- An exclusion list restored from the `.aicb.json`, its opt-out and a generated list take effect
  at once, and the Solutions tab's picker shows it. A GUI analysis filters with the list in force
  when it starts.
- `Export Config` writes back the suppressions only the file holds, but not one you lifted in the
  Insights panel, and keeps the file's settings for every axis the solution has no choice of its
  own for; the confirmation names what it kept and counts what it wrote. `Import Config` takes keep
  rules, the test axis and `exclusionsDisabled` from the file and keeps a `Strict` layering policy.
  A GUI export with a layer profile judges its QUALITY_FINDINGS under it and writes no insight run
  into the history.
- A settings panel that refuses a save keeps your input in the editor and shows the stored entry
  in the list, and a built-in entry is no longer left marked "Overridden"; an entry an earlier
  version marked that way is put right with Restore.
- Imports: Settings > Constellations lists the problems a preview found and disables Apply; a
  panel import refuses the whole file and names the first problem.
- The pipeline-profile editor names the 8000-token floor of Max Token Budget, refuses a new value
  below it, marks a stored one, and raises an imported value with a notice.
- A dialog that appears during startup (database newer than the build, migration failed,
  unfinished runs, MSBuild not found, a startup error) is shown in front with the keyboard focus
  instead of behind the splash.
- The debt label rounds before it picks its unit (477 to 479 minutes read `~1 d`). The built-in
  LLM prompts that ask for severity words show the marker where the findings parser reads it. The
  MCP usage panel's Batch column counts sub-queries that answered.

### In the repository

- **A GitHub Action** at the repository root runs the quality gate in one step: it sets up the
  .NET 10 SDK, installs the tool, restores the solution and runs `aicb analyze`
  (`uses: gregordadera/aicb-roslyn-mcp@main`); see the README.
- **The container runs as a non-root user.** Run it as the owner of the mounted folder and
  restore the solution inside it first; the README shows the commands.

### Data

- A snapshot, saved session or remembered codebase from an earlier version is analyzed afresh the
  first time it is used.
- The configuration database is updated the first time this version opens it: the built-in tag
  schemas that never reached an export are removed, and an MD profile rung or a saved session
  that named one now names the schema that renders in its place.

## 0.5.500.1 (2026-10-04) - Runs on .NET 10, loads classic .NET Framework projects, and every tool description fits in 2048 characters

**Who is affected.** Users of the .NET tool: it now needs **.NET 10**. A machine that has only
.NET 8 or .NET 9 cannot start this version - install the .NET 10 SDK first, then update. The
Windows installer and the portable ZIP bring their own runtime and need nothing beyond the usual
update. Anyone with classic (non-SDK-style) .NET Framework projects: such a solution now loads.
Everyone on the MCP server: reconnect your client once - 32 of the 54 tools of the default profile
have a new description, and every tool now lists a title and the MCP annotation hints. Several
answers are sharper: `find_dead_code` lists unused private methods, `find_tests_for` finds the
tests that read a property or field. Callers that pass a `dbPath` to a tool that only reads a
database: a path that does not exist is now an error. The configuration database does not
change. A snapshot or remembered codebase saved by an earlier version is analyzed afresh the
first time it is used, and the first open of each solution after the update runs its full
design-time build once.

### The .NET tool needs .NET 10

- **The .NET tool `aicb-roslyn-mcp` runs on .NET 10** and needs the .NET 10 SDK; up to 0.5.465.11
  it was .NET 8. Without .NET 10 it runs on the next newer .NET on the machine and needs that
  version's SDK. A machine that has only .NET 8 or .NET 9 cannot start it.
- **Updating:** install the .NET 10 SDK, then `dotnet tool update -g aicb-roslyn-mcp`. The
  requirement concerns the machine `aicb` runs on, not the solutions it analyzes: their target
  frameworks are supported as before.
- Beside a .NET 10 runtime the .NET 8 and .NET 9 SDKs are found as well. An SDK newer than the
  .NET the tool runs on is not (for example a .NET 10 runtime next to only the .NET 11 SDK). The
  environment variable `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor` makes the tool run on the newest .NET; a
  preview .NET additionally needs `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD_TO_PRERELEASE=1`.
- **The message for an MSBuild that could not be registered says what to install:** it names the
  .NET the tool runs on, asks for that version's SDK and names the two switches above. Before, it
  asked for the .NET 8 SDK whatever the tool ran on.
- **The Windows installer and the portable ZIP bring the .NET 10 runtime** instead of .NET 8.
  Analyzing a solution still needs MSBuild on the machine - a .NET SDK or Visual Studio.
- **In a container:** the repository's `Dockerfile` builds on the .NET 10 SDK image. The earlier
  file installed the newest tool onto the .NET 8 SDK image, which cannot start this version; build
  from the current file.
- **The analysis runs on Roslyn 5.9.0** instead of 5.3.0. A source generator built for a newer
  compiler than the host's cannot be loaded and is listed under `generatedCodeGaps`; with 5.3.0
  that included the Razor compiler of a current .NET 10 SDK. Such projects are compiled with their
  generated code again.
- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` follows the new components, among them Roslyn 5.9.0 and SQLite 3.53.4.

### Classic .NET Framework projects load

- **A solution that contains a project in the classic, non-SDK format loads.** Up to 0.5.465.11
  one such project could fail the whole solution, its SDK-style projects included. Classic projects
  are built with the .NET Framework MSBuild, so they need Windows with Visual Studio or the Build
  Tools for Visual Studio, and the .NET Framework targeting pack the project names.
- **Without Visual Studio the load does not fail:** the loader uses the .NET SDK's MSBuild instead.
  When a classic project fails then, `get_diagnostics` marks its entry under
  `designTimeBuildFailures.projects` with the new field `missingMSBuild` (`visual-studio`, or
  `mono` on Linux and macOS), and the `note` says what to install - neither `dotnet restore`
  nor another .NET SDK brings the missing MSBuild.
- **The COM references of a classic project resolve on x64 Windows.** The interop assemblies the
  analysis generates for them go into a folder of its own,
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIContextBuilder\design-time-build`, not into the project's `obj` folder, so
  your own build and the analysis leave each other's interop assemblies alone. The new
  environment variable `AICB_DESIGN_TIME_BUILD_DIR` names another folder, or switches this off
  with `0`. The first load of a project with COM references generates them and can take a
  minute; later loads reuse them. After a COM library is updated or registered again on the
  machine, the next load in a new process imports it again; a running server needs
  `refresh_session(force: true)`.
- **Two aicb processes that load the same classic project with COM references for the first time
  wait for each other** instead of colliding in that folder. The lock sits beside the interop
  folder; a process that waited five minutes builds anyway.
- **A COM reference that still does not resolve** - its library is not registered on the
  machine, the project is SDK-style, or the host is not an x64 Windows - is in most cases listed
  in the new field `comReferences` of the same entry, and the `note` names the way out: reference
  an interop assembly, or install what registers the library. The errors that name types of such
  a library are fallout of the missing reference, not findings about the source.
- **`analyze_solution`** says so when a load fails because the MSBuild of the chosen Visual Studio
  installation could not be loaded and the solution names classic projects: repair that
  installation, or analyze a subset solution without the classic projects.
- The `docs` tool's overview page describes the case.

### Tool descriptions, titles and annotation hints

- **Every tool description is at most 2048 characters.** Claude Code passes only the first 2048
  characters of a tool description to the model, and in 0.5.465.11 the descriptions of 21 of the
  54 tools of the default profile ran past that. The rewritten texts say what the tool does, when
  to use it, what comes back and what it writes.
- **Tools with a new description** (37 of all 82, 32 of them in the default profile):
  `analyze_solution`, `batch`, `calls_external`, `check_solution_config_drift`, `coverage_gaps`,
  `detect_circular_dependencies`, `export_markdown`, `find_binding_usages`, `find_by_code_traits`,
  `find_by_concurrency_risk`, `find_by_event_subscription`, `find_by_resource_leak`,
  `find_by_semantics`, `find_by_side_effects`, `find_dead_code`, `find_implementations`,
  `find_overrides`, `find_production_dead`, `find_resource_usages`, `find_structural_twins`,
  `find_tests_for`, `find_unresolved_bindings`, `find_usages`, `get_diagnostics`,
  `get_type_hierarchy`, `impact_of_change`, `init_solution_config`, `instantiation_sites`,
  `prepare_task`, `resolve_injection`, `review_context`, `save_session`, `server_info`,
  `solution_metrics`, `symbol_metrics`, `symbol_signature`, `usage_report`.
- **The `sessionId` parameter says that it also takes a solution path:** in every tool but one
  that has the parameter, its text now names the absolute `.sln`, `.slnx` or `.slnf` path,
  analyzed on first use. No tool, parameter or response field was added, removed or renamed by
  the rewrite.
- **Every tool lists a `title` and the four MCP annotation hints** - `readOnlyHint`,
  `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint` and `openWorldHint` - in `tools/list`; none did before.
  Eleven tools are not read-only: `analyze_solution`, `refresh_session`, `recall_codebase`,
  `save_session`, `diff_review`, `export_markdown`, `install_agent_hooks`,
  `apply_solution_config`, `remember_codebase`, `refresh_remembered` and
  `import_constellation`; the last six are marked destructive, because they can overwrite a file
  or a stored entry. Six of the eleven are in the default profile. A client that decides by these
  hints whether to ask before a call can now tell the writers from the 71 readers.
- The help text of `aicb mcp` and of its `--db-path` option is reworded; no option changed.

### Sharper answers

- **`find_dead_code` lists private methods that nothing calls.** With `kinds='method'` (the
  default) it effectively listed none before. Methods a framework calls are declined, not judged,
  and counted in the new field `methodsIneligibleFrameworkInvoked`: those carrying `[RelayCommand]`
  or another framework attribute, partial methods, event handlers of markup code-behind and
  designer types, a static `Main`, a record's `PrintMembers`, and a `ShouldSerialize<P>` or
  `Reset<P>` method beside a property `P`. `methodsIneligibleUnanalyzedCallers` now counts only
  methods whose callers were not measured. The insight `quality-dead-code-private`
  (`list_insights` and the desktop app) uses the same rule and reports findings for the first
  time; a comparison against a snapshot saved by an earlier version shows them as new.
- **More callers are recorded** in `find_usages`, `impact_of_change` and `call_graph`: a
  `nameof(M)` inside a method's own attribute (`[RelayCommand(CanExecute = nameof(CanSave))]`,
  `[MemberData(nameof(Cases))]`) counts that method as a caller of `M`; so do the bodies of
  operators, conversions and finalizers, the arguments a primary constructor passes to its base,
  and a type's `[DebuggerDisplay]` format.
- **`find_tests_for` finds the tests that read or write a property or field.** A property or field
  query matched test names only before; it now matches tests that access it, under the new
  `matchReason` values `accesses` and `accesses-via` (strong, ranked after the calls). A type query
  also counts tests that read the type's static members, and `invokesTotal` includes these rows. A
  `Type.Member` query matches a test by name only when both names appear. `assert_absence` with
  `no_tests` counts the reading and writing tests in its reason.
- **Qualified names:** `symbol_signature` takes `Type.Member` and qualified type names (`Ns.Type`,
  `Outer.Inner`); `symbol_metrics` takes `Type..ctor` for one type's constructors. A qualified query
  that resolves to nothing, but whose last part is a declared name, answers `not_found` with that
  name as `nearest`. `find_overrides` (on an empty answer) and `get_type_hierarchy` (on `not_found`) now
  carry `nearest` too.
- **Same-named symbols of another kind:** `impact_of_change` has a new field `collision` that names
  them, ahead of the counts, which still describe the resolved symbol; `find_usages` names them in
  more cases, also when the answer is a type.
- **`find_resource_usages`** reads the `ResourceKey=` forms - `{StaticResource ResourceKey=X}`,
  `{DynamicResource ResourceKey=X}` and the element `<StaticResource ResourceKey="X" />`. With a
  `scope` it says what the solution holds outside that scope; before, a scoped call could answer
  that a key existed nowhere in the markup when it existed outside the scope.
- **`instantiation_sites`** steers only to interfaces something in the solution is injected
  under, and on an empty answer names the markup views that use the type.
- **`detect_circular_dependencies`** marks a cycle whose witness list was cut at 50 edges with the
  new field `edgesTruncated`.
- **`get_diagnostics`:** under `generatedCodeGaps` a generator that loads and then fails is named
  with the new kinds `cannot-run` (it needs a newer version of an assembly than the .NET the tool
  runs on; the note names `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor` or an SDK pinned in `global.json` as
  the repair) and `run-failed`. `designTimeBuildFailures` no longer lists a restore warning that
  every build repeats (a NuGet audit warning) or a solution entry in a language aicb does not load
  (`.shproj`, `.dcproj`), and its note says that MSBuild reports a warning the way it reports an
  error.
- The note on generated sources that `find_symbol` and `symbol_signature` add to an empty answer
  no longer counts generated files that declare no type.

### Faster repeat opens

- **A solution with a NuGet audit warning or a `.shproj` or `.dcproj` entry is now cached** like
  any other, so opening it again no longer repeats the full design-time build.
- Editing a shared project's `.projitems` file invalidates the cached build of the solutions that
  include it.

### A reading tool does not create a database

- **A tool that only reads a database refuses a `dbPath` that does not exist.** The error starts
  with `dbPath not found: <path>. This tool only reads the database and does not create one` and
  names the tools that do create it. Before, such a call created the folder and an empty database
  at the path and answered from it.
  This applies to `analyze_solution`, `diff_review`, `solution_config_status`,
  `check_solution_config_drift`, `list_insights`, `get_insight`, `solution_metrics`,
  `evaluate_change_set`, `compare_with_previous`, `diff_public_contract`, `list_remembered` and
  `recall_codebase`, and to the resource `acb://snapshots/{hash}`.
- The tools that write keep creating the database: `apply_solution_config`, `save_session`,
  `remember_codebase` and `refresh_remembered`. A call without `dbPath` is not affected.
- **`aicb call --db-path <path>` follows the same rule:** for a tool that writes, a database that
  does not exist is created; for a read-only tool the call is refused with
  `--db-path not found: <path>`.
- A configuration database deleted while the server runs is no longer re-created as an empty file
  when the server records a call.

### Solutions the desktop app has not registered

- **`save_session`, `remember_codebase`, `apply_solution_config` and `aicb analyze
  --emit-session-db` no longer switch on automatic configuration for a solution the desktop app
  has not registered.** The desktop app still switches it on when it registers the solution.
  `apply_solution_config` keeps the `autoInit` block a committed `.aicb.json` already has instead
  of writing one of its own, and so does the desktop app's configuration export.
- The `configInit.directive` of `analyze_solution` says where the setting is stored and that it
  is a stored setting, not a request made in the conversation.
- `save_session` called with a solution path returns the session id as `sessionId`, not the path.

### Memory, and files saved during an analysis

- **The MCP server and the desktop app give memory back after a load.** About two seconds after
  an analysis, a recall, an evicted session or a larger refresh (the server), or after a solution
  has finished loading (the desktop app), the process returns the memory the load no longer needs.
  The environment variable `AICB_MEMORY_TRIM=0` (also `off` or `false`) switches this off.
- **Reloading a solution no longer keeps the previous load in memory.** In a long-running
  process every full reload added to the memory in use.
- **A file saved while an analysis runs is picked up by the next refresh.** `analyze_solution`,
  `remember_codebase`, `refresh_remembered` and the desktop app take the file baseline of a
  session before they read the solution. Before, it was taken after the analysis, so such a file
  could count as current although the analysis held its old content.

### Package

- The description of the package on nuget.org names what the server does in the words people
  search for: semantic code analysis, navigation, the impact of a change, dependency injection
  and refactoring.

## 0.5.465.11 (2026-09-30) - The .NET tool is now `aicb-roslyn-mcp`, and every tool applies a solution's configuration in the same order

**Who is affected.** Users of the .NET tool: the NuGet package has a new name, and an existing
installation is switched once by hand (below). Anyone who commits a `.aicb.json` next to a solution
or configures solutions in the desktop app: `analyze_solution`, the memory tools,
`solution_config_status`, `check_solution_config_drift` and `aicb analyze` now apply and report one
and the same configuration. The Windows installer and the portable ZIP need nothing beyond the
usual update. No database change; saved snapshots stay valid. If your client caches tool
descriptions, reconnect it once - the descriptions of `analyze_solution`, `solution_config_status`,
`check_solution_config_drift`, `remember_codebase` and `recall_codebase` changed.

### The .NET tool is now the NuGet package `aicb-roslyn-mcp`

- **The MCP server and CLI are published on nuget.org as
  [`aicb-roslyn-mcp`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aicb-roslyn-mcp)** - up to 0.5.465.1 the package
  was called `AIContextBuilder`. The command stays `aicb`, and the MCP Registry entry
  `io.github.gregordadera/aicb-roslyn-mcp` names the new package.
- **Switching an existing installation:** `dotnet tool update` does not cross the rename. Run
  `dotnet tool uninstall -g AIContextBuilder`, then `dotnet tool install -g aicb-roslyn-mcp`. An MCP
  client configuration that starts the `aicb` command needs no change; one that starts the package
  itself with `dnx AIContextBuilder` needs the new name.
- The package `AIContextBuilder` stays on nuget.org with its versions, is marked deprecated with a
  pointer to the new name, and receives no further versions.
- The Windows installer removes an existing .NET tool under either name when you let it. Winget keeps
  the identifier `GregorDadera.AIContextBuilder`.
- The package carries the tag `aicb`, so a nuget.org search for the command name finds it.

### One order for a solution's configuration

- **`analyze_solution`, `solution_config_status`, `check_solution_config_drift` and `aicb analyze`
  resolve a solution's namespace exclusions, layer profile, test profile and analysis scope in one
  order:** an explicit parameter, then the configuration database (a choice made for this solution,
  then the app-wide default), then the `.aicb.json` committed next to the solution, then a built-in
  default.
- **A built-in default no longer overrides a committed `.aicb.json`.** Where the configuration
  database only falls back to the built-in exclusion list, or its app-wide default is the `Empty`
  layer preset or the default test profile, the `.aicb.json` now applies. Before, `analyze_solution`
  then analyzed with the built-in exclusion list while `solution_config_status` named the
  `.aicb.json` as the source. A choice made for one solution still wins over the `.aicb.json`, even
  when it names a built-in - that is how a single solution opts out of the committed profile.
- **`solution_config_status` and `check_solution_config_drift` report the configuration in force**,
  the one an analysis of the solution runs on, each with its `source`: `explicit`, `db`, `sidecar`,
  `none`, or the new `built-in` for the built-in exclusion list. `check_solution_config_drift`
  evaluates that configuration instead of whichever `.aicb.json` it found.
- **`aicb analyze` uses the test profile of a `.aicb.json`** for test-project detection in the
  quality gate and the snapshot's debt, and prints on stderr which layer or test profile it takes
  from the `.aicb.json`, as it already did for a configured one.

### The memory tools analyze like `analyze_solution`

- **`remember_codebase`, `recall_codebase` and `refresh_remembered` apply the same configuration as
  `analyze_solution`** - the configuration database first, then the `.aicb.json`, then a built-in
  default; an explicit `layerProfile` on `remember_codebase` still wins. Before, they read only the
  `.aicb.json`, and from it only the exclusions and the analysis scope: no layer profile unless one
  was passed, no test profile, never the configuration database. On the default `aicb mcp` server a
  remembered session could therefore show other dependencies than `analyze_solution` on the same
  solution, and a recalled session classified test projects by the built-in default whatever the
  repository pinned. A configuration database that cannot be opened now fails the recall, as it
  fails an analysis.

### Fixed

- **Asking `solution_config_status` or `check_solution_config_drift` about a solution no longer
  registers it in the configuration database.** The first such question created an entry for the
  solution whose defaults made the next `analyze_solution` state in `configInit.directive` that the
  user had opted the solution into automatic initialization, which nobody had.
  `apply_solution_config` still creates the entry, since it has a configuration to store.

## 0.5.465.1 (2026-09-29) - New repository name, starts without .NET 8, calls through interfaces are credited to their implementations

**Who is affected.** Everyone: the repository has a new address (every old link keeps working), and
the MCP Registry lists the server under a new name. Users of the .NET tool can now start it on a
machine without .NET 8. Everything else concerns the MCP server and the `aicb` CLI: `find_usages`,
`impact_of_change`, `find_tests_for`, `coverage_gaps` and the tools that repeat their numbers,
`analyze_solution` and the session tools, `export_markdown`, `refresh_session` and
`evaluate_change_set`. No database change; saved snapshots stay valid. If your client caches tool
descriptions, reconnect it once - several descriptions changed.

### New repository address and MCP Registry name

- **The repository moved to `github.com/gregordadera/aicb-roslyn-mcp`** (it was
  `github.com/gregordadera/AICB`). GitHub forwards every old link, clone URL and release download,
  so nothing you set up breaks; update bookmarks and git remotes when convenient. The nuget.org
  package `AIContextBuilder` and the `aicb` command keep their names.
- **The MCP Registry lists the server as `io.github.gregordadera/aicb-roslyn-mcp`.** The previous
  entry `io.github.gregordadera/aicb` keeps its published versions and is marked deprecated with a
  pointer to the new name. Clients that already run the server need no change: they start the
  `aicb` command, not the registry name.
- The desktop app's About page and the `docs` tool link to the new address.

### Listed as an MCP server on nuget.org

- **The NuGet package carries the MCP server package type** next to the .NET tool type, and it
  packs its `server.json` as `.mcp/server.json`. nuget.org lists packages of that type in its MCP
  server filter and builds a client configuration from that file. An existing installation needs
  no change.

### Starts where only a newer .NET is installed

- **The .NET tool now also starts on a machine that has no .NET 8 runtime but a newer one.** It then
  runs on the next newer .NET on the machine and needs that version's SDK, so just the .NET 10 SDK
  works. That is what the configuration nuget.org offers needs: it starts the tool with `dnx` from
  the .NET 10 SDK, and neither `dnx` nor a global install switches to a newer runtime on its own.
  Tested in an environment that holds only the .NET 10 runtime and SDK: the tool starts through
  `dnx` and as a global install, analyzes a `net8.0` and a `net10.0` solution, and answers as an MCP
  server. Where .NET 8 is installed, the tool keeps using it and nothing changes.
- **If the .NET it runs on has no SDK of its own** (for example a .NET 9 runtime next to the .NET 10
  SDK), the tool reports that MSBuild could not be registered. Install the .NET 8 SDK, or set the
  environment variable `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor` so that it uses the newest .NET.
- The installer and the portable ZIP bring their own runtime and are not affected.

### A call through an interface is credited to the implementing method

- **`find_usages` and `impact_of_change` credit a call through an interface or abstract member to
  the method that implements it.** Such a call binds to the interface member, so a qualified method
  query (`Type.Method`) used to miss it, and a method called only through its interface looked
  unused. Those callers are now listed and counted, and `viaContract` says how many were credited,
  through which members and how many types implement each; `viaContractNote` says whether the credit
  is exact (one production implementation) or a union over several. A method in a test project is
  never credited.
- **`find_tests_for` adds the tiers `dispatch` and `dispatch-via`** for a test that calls an
  interface or abstract member the symbol implements, directly or through one method it calls. They
  rank behind the strong tiers and are counted in `dispatchTotal`, because the test may have run a
  sibling implementation or a test double instead.
- **`coverage_gaps` marks with `viaDispatch` a method that only such a test reaches.** Every other
  entry keeps the depth it had.
- **The tools that repeat these numbers carry the qualifier with them.** `review_context` and
  `diff_review` include `viaContract`, `viaContractNote` and `dispatchTotal`; `explain_symbol` says how
  many of the callers call the contract; `verify_claim` with `symbol_removed_unused` answers
  `indeterminate` for a removed method whose only callers called its interface; and
  `find_by_complexity_and_coverage` still counts a method that only a dispatch test reaches as
  untested (`reachedOnlyThroughDispatch`), so the complex-and-untested insight and its debt estimate
  do not shrink without a test being added.

### An answer too large to deliver is refused with its size

- **An answer over 16,000,000 bytes as JSON is refused on `tools/call` and on resource reads**, and the
  refusal names the size and the remedy: `outputPath` for `export_markdown`, a narrower query
  otherwise. Before, `export_markdown` on a large solution failed only after the work, with a bare
  `-32603: An error occurred.`, and a client that closes the connection on a message above 16 MiB lost
  every session the server held.
- **The limit is set with `AICB_MCP_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`** (thousands separators are accepted; the
  value is capped at what the JSON serializer can write). A refused tool call is counted as a failure
  in `usage_report`; a refused resource read is not recorded. `aicb call` prints the text directly
  and is not affected.

### `analyze_solution` says when a load was incomplete

- **The session answer carries `incompleteRun` when scanned projects could not bind their core
  framework types** (for example a missing targeting pack): how many, out of how many, the first ten
  names, and a note naming the repair - `refresh_session` with `force=true`, or `refresh_remembered`
  for a session restored with `recall_codebase`. It appears on `analyze_solution`, `refresh_session`,
  `inspect_session`, `list_sessions`, `recall_codebase` and `remember_codebase`, and only for an
  incomplete run, so a healthy answer is unchanged. Before, the first answer said nothing, and only a
  later refresh or `get_diagnostics` showed it. Its absence is no all-clear: `get_diagnostics` names
  the errors of a project that binds its framework but is still not restored.

### Fixed

- **A refresh keeps the namespace exclusions of the first analysis.** With a configuration database -
  the default `aicb mcp` server always has one - `analyze_solution` applied the active
  `Exclude Namespaces` list to the first analysis but not to later refreshes, whether an explicit
  `refresh_session` or the automatic one after an edit. Dependencies, metrics and insights of an
  unchanged solution could therefore change after a refresh. Sessions from `remember_codebase` and
  `refresh_remembered` had the same gap.
- **`evaluate_change_set` analyzes the proposed change with the session's namespace exclusions**, so a
  dependency the exclusions hide is no longer reported as introduced by the change.

## 0.5.464.66 (2026-09-28) - SQLite closes CVE-2025-6965, `get_diagnostics` names what it could not compile, `prepare_task` stays within a budget

**Who is affected.** Everyone gets the SQLite security update and the editorial license version 0.6.
Everything else concerns the MCP server and the `aicb` CLI: `get_diagnostics`, `prepare_task`,
`find_tests_for`, `review_context`, `instantiation_sites`, `symbol_metrics`, `resolve_injection`,
`impact_of_change`, `find_dead_code` and `list_insights`. No database change; saved snapshots stay
valid. The local-function fix below takes effect when a solution is analyzed again. If your client
caches tool descriptions, reconnect it once - several descriptions changed.

### Security

- **The bundled SQLite library moves from 3.41.2 to 3.53.3**, which fixes CVE-2025-6965
  (GHSA-2m69-gcr7-jv3q, severity high). aicb uses SQLite only for its own local database and runs
  only its own SQL, so the practical exposure was low - but the vulnerable native library shipped in
  the NuGet tool package, the installer and the portable ZIP, where a vulnerability scanner reports
  it. Existing databases open unchanged; no re-analysis is needed. `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` lists
  the updated `SQLitePCLRaw` 2.1.13 packages.

### Licensing

- **EULA version 0.6 is an editorial version with unchanged terms.** The German part now uses real
  umlauts instead of transliterations, and dashes became plain hyphens. Prices, thresholds and every
  right and obligation are the same as in version 0.5. The immutable reference is the tag `eula-v0.6`.

### `get_diagnostics` says what it could not compile

- **A failed design-time build is disclosed in `designTimeBuildFailures`.** When MSBuild fails while
  loading a project - a version task on a shallow clone is the typical case - the project is still
  compiled with what could be read, so its compiler options can be incomplete, and that moves the
  counts in both directions. The answer now lists each affected project file with the loader's own
  message and a note naming the remedy, whenever the scope reaches such a project or one of its
  dependents. A shared failure is quoted once, not once per project.
- **Generated code the analysis could not produce is disclosed in `generatedCodeGaps`.** A project can
  compile without code a source generator or the WPF markup compiler would have written: a generator
  from a project in the solution that was never built (`not-built`), an analyzer file nobody produces
  (`not-found`), a generator built for a newer compiler than the analysis host (`cannot-load` -
  building does not fix that one), a generator that failed to load for another reason (`load-failed`),
  or WPF code-behind whose markup half is missing. Each entry carries its evidence and affected
  dependents; `diagnosticsInAffectedProjects` gives the magnitude and `diagnosticsMarked` counts the
  items marked `missingGeneratedCode: true` because they sit exactly where the code is missing.
- **A file-scoped call names the incomplete project its marked items inherit from.** Under a file-path
  scope, an incomplete project is listed whenever a counted diagnostic in the scope sits downstream of
  it, so a `cascadeFromIncomplete` item always has its cause named. `suppressedDiagnosticsTotal` now
  appears whenever `incompleteRatio` does, and a scoped call reaches `inconclusive` only where the
  solution-wide call would too.

### `prepare_task` stays within a budget

- **The template render has a default ceiling.** When neither the MCP profile nor the template sets a
  budget - true for every built-in - the answer could run to hundreds of thousands of characters, and
  to millions for a plain-language goal. The default is now a hard ceiling sized to what an MCP client
  shows inline, and the manifest in front of the context counts toward it. On a goal naming one type,
  about 304 000 characters became about 15 000. A budget you configure keeps its tolerance.
- **A goal that names a declared symbol exactly seeds on the symbols it names.** Its other words still
  steer the trimming but no longer pull in unrelated members - an ordinary word such as "works" or
  "where", or a capitalized first word of the sentence, used to anchor on a like-named method.
- **The type the goal names stays in the answer** even when the budget is tight; if its source does
  not fit, it is shown as structure rather than dropped.
- **The frontmatter stays parseable.** The pruning and budget notes are now placed after the YAML
  frontmatter instead of in front of it.

### Tests and construction sites

- **`find_tests_for` counts a test that builds the queried type.** Two new `matchReason` values,
  `constructs` (the test creates the type: `new X(...)`, target-typed `new()`, a record `with`) and
  `constructs-via` (through one method it calls), apply to type and constructor queries (`Type.Type`)
  and rank after the `invokes` tiers. Building a type does not show that a particular member ran, so
  member queries are unchanged.
- **`review_context` caps its covering tests like `find_tests_for` does** - 50 per symbol, with
  `coveringTestsTotal` and `coveringTestsTruncated`. One symbol could previously return well over a
  hundred rows, and a large solution several thousand in one answer.
- **`instantiation_sites` separates test from production.** Every site carries `isTestProject`, and
  `createdByTests` and `injectedIntoTests` stand beside the totals they split, counted over all sites
  and not just the returned page. "Does anything but a test construct this type?" is now one call.
  The classification follows the session's configured test projects.

### Corrected answers

- **Calls from constructors and property accessors in test projects count as test calls.**
  `impact_of_change` no longer counts them as production impact, and `find_dead_code` reports a
  method that only such test code reaches as unused in production.
- **Local functions of the same name in different methods are no longer merged** in call graphs, so a
  caller of one no longer appears as a caller of the other.
- **`list_insights` drops two false alarms:** `nameof(Task<T>.Result)` is not a blocking wait on a task,
  and `Enumerable.Empty<T>()` inside a loop is not a per-iteration LINQ cost.
- **`resolve_injection` no longer matches a factory registration that returns an anonymous object**
  against an unrelated service. It reports no match, and its note points at the factory site.
- **`symbol_metrics` carries `metricMeaning`** on every answer: cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
  describe code shape, not runtime cost.

### Documentation

- The nuget.org package page now matches this repository's README, names the MCP server and lists its
  search terms. The `aicb-csharp-context` skill explains the new `constructs` reasons of
  `find_tests_for`; `aicb init --force` refreshes an installed copy.
- The general manual's licensing chapter names EULA version 0.6. The printable PDFs still describe
  product state 0.5.464.43.

## 0.5.464.56 (2026-09-26) - the license that ships is the license that is published, and six answers stop hiding what they left out

**Who is affected.** Everyone: the shipped license text moves from EULA v0.3 to v0.5. Beyond that, this
release is mostly about MCP answers and exported Markdown telling you what they omitted - `find_usages`,
`find_symbol`, `symbol_signature`, `architecture_overview`, `solution_config_status`,
`check_solution_config_drift` and `pack_for_task`. No database change, no re-analysis; saved snapshots stay
valid. If your client caches tool descriptions, reconnect it once.

### Licensing

- **The binding agreement shipped with the product is now EULA v0.5**, the same version published here.
  Installer, portable ZIP and the NuGet package carry it, with `LICENSE.txt` as its plain-language summary
  beside it. What v0.4 and v0.5 added over v0.3: commercial licenses **start at EUR 25 per licensed
  developer per month**, a commercial agreement can include defined response and security-fix targets,
  version maintenance, prioritized general product improvements and source-code review under NDA. The
  free thresholds are unchanged - 100 employees, EUR 10 million annual turnover, 21 developers - and so is
  everything about enforcement: no license server, no activation, no timer, no threshold data leaving the
  machine. The 90-day transition period remains contractual text only.
- The nuget.org package page now states the same terms as this repository.

### Answers that now disclose what they omitted

- **`architecture_overview` leads with a `<TRUNCATION>` block** when the document was cut: how many sections
  were capped, how many entries are shown out of how many, and one `SECTION: shown of total` row per cut
  section. Until now the per-section `+N more` lines each named one section and added up for nobody - on a
  large solution that meant 640 of 8706 entries were shown with no statement anywhere that the rest existed.
  The frontmatter of a truncated document stays where it belongs, so `type`, `title` and `description` are
  still parseable.
- **`find_usages` reports `selfReferences`** - how many of the listed users are declared on the queried
  symbol's own type - and adds a note when *all* of them are. That is the answer that reads as outside
  dependence while nothing outside actually depends on the symbol. Self-references are disclosed, never
  filtered out: a self-reference is a real reference.
- **`find_symbol` and `symbol_signature` say when generated C# was skipped.** Generated sources under `obj/`
  stay out of the analysis on purpose - the same file often exists once per target framework, so admitting
  them would multiply every generated type - but a zero-hit answer used to read as "no such type". A
  zero-hit answer on a solution that has such files now says so in `generatedSourcesNote`.
- **A broken `.aicb.json` no longer reads as "nothing configured".** `solution_config_status` and
  `check_solution_config_drift` carry `sidecarProblem` when the sidecar next to the `.sln` exists but cannot
  be used, and they keep an invalid file apart from a locked or unreadable one - a typo is yours to fix, a
  lock is transient. Until now a broken sidecar produced an answer byte-identical to having none, three axes
  reporting `source: "none"`, which is a positive claim that nothing is configured. A healthy answer is
  unchanged.

### Corrected and smaller answers

- **`returnKind` names the return type's family, not its arity.** A plain `Task` was reported as `object`
  while `Task<T>` was `task`, and non-generic `IEnumerable`, `IList`, `ICollection`, plus
  `IReadOnlyCollection` and `IAsyncEnumerable`, fell out of `collection`.
- **`find_usages` on a bare member name no longer mixes namesakes into the self-reference count.** Where a
  short name matches members on several types, the count is omitted rather than reported wrongly; a
  type-qualified query answers as before.
- **Exported Markdown carries a smaller `<COMPRESSION_LEGEND>`.** The legend now explains only the notations
  the finished document actually contains. On a single-symbol export it had grown to about a third of the
  whole document while explaining blocks that were not in it.
- **`pack_for_task` fills the budget it was given, also on slices that had to degrade.** A request whose
  content had to be reduced below the full-code form could settle well under target - measured at about 85 %
  of a 25 000-token budget, below the 92 % the tool aims for; the same request now lands at about 96 %.

### Documentation

- The public documentation gained a measured cold/warm scale benchmark on three public solutions (Serilog,
  MahApps.Metro and RavenDB, cold and warm load, peak memory), a clearer statement of what the static
  analysis does and does not cover, a safe agent workflow, and the licensing pages for the new EULA version.
- The three reference manuals still describe product state 0.5.464.43; their licensing chapter is current
  with EULA v0.5. The changes listed above are described here in the changelog.

## 0.5.464.44 (2026-09-25) - usage check skill and complete browser-readable manuals

**Who is affected.** Users who run `aicb init --skills=all`, and anyone reading the public
documentation. The analysis engine, MCP tool answers, desktop app and saved snapshots are unchanged.

- **A fourth optional Agent Skill ships:** `aicb-usage-check` calls `usage_report` at the end of a
  task and summarizes which AICB tools were actually used, which offered tools went untouched, and
  what the calls cost. It is deliberately opt-in alongside the review pair; the default
  `aicb init` still writes only `aicb-csharp-context`. Run `aicb init --skills=all` again in an
  existing project to install it there.
- **The three reference manuals are now readable as Markdown in the browser and by coding agents,**
  one chapter per file, with the printable PDFs beside them under stable names. The manuals describe
  product state 0.5.464.43; build .44 changes only the guard described next.
- **The package page can no longer silently omit a shipped skill.** Every release now checks the
  install page, the CLI help and the package README against the list of skills that actually ship.
  This closes the gap that briefly left the nuget.org page describing only three skills.

## 0.5.464.41 (2026-09-24) - `resolve_injection` says how visible a service is in constructors

**Who is affected.** The MCP server and the `aicb` CLI. **The desktop app is unchanged.** Saved
snapshots stay valid; no database change, no re-analysis.

- **New field `constructorConsumerCount`**: how many distinct types take the queried service as a
  plain constructor parameter. It is on every answer, and a zero is a result rather than a missing
  field - until now a service half the solution injects and one nobody injects produced the same
  answer, because only *optional* constructor parameters were ever reported.
- **Read it as a description, not a verdict.** It counts constructor parameters and nothing else, so
  a service obtained through `GetService<T>`, built inside a factory lambda, or reached by reflection
  or XAML counts 0 while being thoroughly alive. The first live reading makes the point better than
  any warning: a service that almost everything takes as a factory delegate reports **2**. For "is
  this used at all", `find_usages` remains the tool.
- An optional parameter counts here too, and such a consumer still appears on `optionalDependencies`;
  collection consumption keeps its own field and is not counted twice. Consumers declared in test
  projects follow the existing `includeTests` filter.

If your client caches tool descriptions, reconnect it once - the text of `resolve_injection` changed
along with its answer.

## 0.5.464.40 (2026-09-24) - `resolve_injection` stops giving confident wrong answers

Four builds (`.37` to `.40`) that all repair the same tool. Every one of them replaces an answer
that looked definite with one that is either correct or openly says it does not know - which is
the point: a `false` that means "nobody does this" is far more expensive than a "cannot tell".

**Who is affected.** The MCP server and the `aicb` CLI. **The desktop app is unchanged** - it does
not use this analyzer. Saved snapshots stay valid; there is no database change and no re-analysis.

- **`consumedAsCollection` is answered for every query, not only for a conflicting one.** The field
  says whether anything consumes a service as a set (`IEnumerable<T>` in a constructor,
  `GetServices<T>()`). It used to be computed only where it could also downgrade a registration
  conflict, and read `false` everywhere else - so a service registered once, or registered several
  times through factories, always answered `false` no matter how many consumers took the whole set.
  Measured on a real solution, two services answered `false` while a constructor took each of them
  as `IEnumerable<T>`.
- **A factory registration that *returns* its object is now resolved.** `AddSingleton(sp => Foo.Build())`
  and the block form `AddSingleton(sp => { ...; return Foo.Build(); })` used to leave the registration
  with no type name at all - and in this single-argument form the produced type *is* the service, so
  the whole registration answered to no name. `AddSingleton(sp => new Foo())` always worked; the
  difference was only that one returns instead of constructing. A block body is read only when all of
  its `return` statements agree, and a `return` inside a nested lambda or local function is correctly
  ignored.
- **A registration the scanner can see but cannot parse is now disclosed as such.** Before, such a
  site was invisible, and the answer explained the resulting zero with *"Autofac, Castle Windsor and
  Scrutor are out of scope"* - pointing away from the file that actually held the binding. The note
  now separates *"a Microsoft-DI registration was seen here but its type could not be read"* from
  *"no Microsoft-DI registration was found"*, and names the site.
- **Optional and nullable collection parameters count.** `IEnumerable<IFoo>? foos = null` - a consumer
  that tolerates an empty set - was not counted as consuming the collection, and neither was
  `IEnumerable<IFoo?>`.
- **Consumers declared in test projects no longer count by default.** This one changes an answer you
  may have relied on: collection consumption now obeys the same `includeTests` filter the registration
  list has always obeyed. Before, a test fixture taking `IEnumerable<T>` could mark a genuine
  production conflict between two registrations as deliberate, hiding it. Pass `includeTests=true` to
  get the old, solution-wide reading.

If your client caches tool descriptions, reconnect it once - the text of `resolve_injection` changed
along with its behavior.

## 0.5.464.36 (2026-09-23) - internal wiring, nothing you can see

A plumbing release. No tool changes its answer, the CLI and the desktop app behave
exactly as in 0.5.464.35, and there is no reason to update in a hurry.

- **The MCP server's insights now see the queue of work items**, as the desktop app's
  already did. No MCP tool reads that queue yet, so no answer changes; the connection
  keeps a future tool from reporting "nothing is queued" when the queue was simply not
  connected. The desktop app was never affected.
- **One consequence worth stating:** in a setup where the MCP server is pointed at a
  database, an insights run now performs one additional indexed read against it - the same
  read the desktop app already does - and currently discards the result. Analysis still
  runs entirely on your machine, and the MCP server still writes nothing.

## 0.5.464.35 (2026-09-23) - two answers about C# code that were quietly wrong

Analysis-engine changes, so they reach the MCP server, the CLI and the desktop app alike.

- **`resolve_injection` discloses optional constructor dependencies.** A constructor
  parameter with a default (`IFoo? foo = null`) that nothing in the registration set fills
  used to fall between two answers - the tool listed what was registered, never whether it
  arrived. The answer now carries an `optionalDependencies` axis naming every such consumer,
  with a verdict of `yes`, `no` or `unknown` per construction. The verdict follows **who
  selects the constructor**: the container when the consumer is registered by type, the
  argument list when a factory lambda or a hand-built instance constructs it. Where the
  analyzer cannot see how the consumer is built - construction inside a helper method,
  `ActivatorUtilities`, several constructors to choose between, two types of the same short
  name - it answers `unknown` with a reason rather than a plausible guess. Answers for
  services with no optional consumer are byte-identical to before.
- **A static constructor no longer shares its caller entry with the parameterless one.**
  `static C()` and `C()` were registered under one key, so `find_usages` merged the callers
  of the two bodies and could not tell which one called what. The static constructor now
  keys as `C.static C()`, in `find_usages`, `call_graph`, `impact_of_change` and the
  exported Markdown.
- **Saved snapshots:** the payload format moves to 56, so a snapshot written by an older
  version is re-analyzed instead of loaded. Nothing is lost; the first analysis after the
  update takes its usual time.
- The desktop app is otherwise unchanged since 0.5.464.32.

## 0.5.464.33 (2026-09-21) - manuals linked from the package page

- Full manuals as PDF (General, MCP server, Desktop app) in
  [`docs/manual/`](https://github.com/gregordadera/AICB/tree/main/docs/manual), linked from the
  README and therefore from the nuget.org package page.
- No code change: the MCP server and CLI behave exactly like 0.5.464.32. Published on
  nuget.org only; the desktop app stays at 0.5.464.32.

## 0.5.464.32 (2026-09-21) - one installation per machine

- **The installer removes an existing .NET tool** (option, preselected). The installer
  contains the same MCP server and CLI; with both installed, Windows starts the
  installer's `aicb` first, so `dotnet tool update` updated a copy no MCP client ran.
  Now one `aicb` per machine, and a desktop-app update brings the MCP server along. If
  the tool is still running as an agent's MCP server, the installer asks you to close
  the agent and retry.
- **`aicb init` warns when `aicb` is installed more than once** and names the copy that
  actually runs.
- The installer's last page says that consoles, editors and agents that were already
  open see the new `PATH` only after a restart.
- Published builds report a plain version number (`0.5.464.32`) without a build commit
  suffix.
- Install guidance in README, Getting started and the `aicb-csharp-context` skill:
  Windows with the desktop app → installer only; everywhere else → the .NET tool.

## 0.5.464.31 (2026-09-20) - first public release

The first release published outside the author's own machine.

**MCP server and CLI** (`dotnet tool install -g AIContextBuilder` from nuget.org, Windows / Linux / macOS)

- A Roslyn-backed MCP server (`aicb mcp`, stdio) that answers the questions a coding
  agent has before it edits C#: callers and blast radius, implementations and
  overrides, covering tests, injected dependencies, side effects, dead code, dependency
  cycles, live compiler diagnostics - and packs task-sized context for a model.
- Serves both current MCP protocol revisions (`2026-07-28` and `2025-11-25`) from one
  binary.
- Self-init: every tool accepts the absolute `.sln` / `.slnx` / `.slnf` path as its
  session; no separate analyze step.
- A lean default tool pool across nine task facets; the full surface is one profile
  switch away (`--mcp-profile mcp-profile/full`).
- `aicb init` wires a project in one step: `.mcp.json`, the `aicb-csharp-context` agent
  skill, and - for Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode - the optional symbol guard.
- CLI verbs `init`, `analyze`, `export`, `import`, `list`, `mcp` and `call` (one tool,
  once, from a plain shell).

**Desktop app** (Windows, installer or portable ZIP from the release assets)

- Curate by hand what a model sees: pick types and methods, set a detail level per
  node, watch the token estimate, render the context document, and copy, save or send
  it to a model profile you configured (local models included).
- Workspace with solution tabs, snapshots, sessions, insights and the MCP usage view;
  light and dark theme.

**Privacy.** Analysis runs entirely on your machine. The CLI and the MCP server have
no network capability at all; the desktop app talks only to a model endpoint you
configured yourself, for example when you press *Send to API*. No telemetry, no update
check, no crash reporting.

**Known limits.** Analysis needs MSBuild (a .NET SDK or Visual Studio) on the machine.
The Windows downloads are not code-signed yet, so SmartScreen asks once. C# only;
third-party analyzers are not run.
