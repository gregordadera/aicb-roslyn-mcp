# 2 Setting up an agent: aicb init

`aicb init` is the command that connects a project to an agent. It writes the files an MCP client reads - the server entry and the agent skills - and, for the agent harnesses the project uses, it installs the **symbol guard**: a hook that refuses a C# symbol search and redirects the agent to the semantic aicb tools.

The command only writes files. It opens no solution and starts no analysis: no Roslyn, no MSBuild, no database. You can run it in any project directory, before anything is built, and even in a directory that holds no solution at all - the guard itself only acts where a solution is present (see "When the guard stays silent").

## 2.1 What it writes at a glance

| Artifact | Location, relative to the project directory | Written when |
|---|---|---|
| MCP client entry | `.mcp.json` | always |
| Server entry for Codex / OpenCode | `.codex/config.toml` / `opencode.json` | for Codex or OpenCode when detected or named, also with `--hooks none` |
| Agent skills | `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | always; one skill by default, three with `--skills all` |
| Agent skills for Codex / OpenCode | `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | for Codex or OpenCode when detected or named |
| Symbol guard script(s) | `.claude/hooks/`, `.codex/hooks/` or `.opencode/plugins/` | for every harness that is detected or named |
| Harness wiring | `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json` or `opencode.json` | for every harness that is detected or named |

The run attempts the artifacts in a fixed order: `.mcp.json` first, then the Codex and OpenCode server entries, then the skills, then **all** guard scripts, then **all** wiring entries. Harness detection happens before the first write, so the run can never count a directory it created itself as evidence that a harness is in use. Each artifact reports its own result - one failure does not cost the others and does not hide them.

Every file is written atomically: a temporary file in the same directory is filled first and then moved over the target. An interrupted run therefore cannot leave a truncated `.mcp.json` (which would silently remove every other MCP server you had registered).

## 2.2 Before you run it

`aicb init` assumes the `aicb` command is already installed. The .NET tool needs the .NET 10 SDK:

```sh
dotnet tool install -g aicb-roslyn-mcp
aicb --version
```

On Windows with the desktop app, install the Windows installer instead - it contains the same server and keeps one `aicb` per machine. If more than one `aicb` is on your `PATH`, `aicb init` warns you (see "What a run reports").

Then open a terminal in the project directory you want to wire up:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
aicb init
```

## 2.3 Options

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--path <dir>` | the current directory | The project directory to wire up. A directory that does not exist is an error: `error: directory not found: <dir>`, exit code `1`. |
| `--force` | off | Overwrite artifacts that are already there. Without it, an existing aicb entry, skill file, guard script or wiring entry is left exactly as it is - which is what makes re-running the command safe. |
| `--skills <context\|all>` | `context` | `context` writes only `aicb-csharp-context`; `all` additionally writes the `aicb-code-review` / `aicb-code-simplifier` review pair and `aicb-usage-check`. |
| `--hooks <auto\|none\|all\|claude-code\|codex\|opencode>` | `auto` | Which harnesses get the symbol guard and its wiring. `auto` installs for the harnesses already used in this project; `none` installs no enforcement at all; `all` installs for all three; the three ids name one harness each. |

An unknown `--hooks` value is rejected before the directory is even checked, because a typo in your own text does not depend on the file system:

```text
error: --hooks '<value>' is not one of: auto, none, all, claude-code, codex, opencode
```

`--skills` accepts only its two values; anything else is rejected by the command-line parser before the command runs.

## 2.4 Step by step: the first setup

1. Install `aicb` and confirm it answers: `aicb --version`.
2. Change into your project directory and run `aicb init`. Add `--skills all` if you also want the review pair and the usage check, or `--hooks none` if you want no enforcement.
3. Read the report. Every artifact gets one line; if a line says `refused`, nothing was written for that file, the exit code is `1`, and the line says what to fix. Repair the file and run the command again.
4. Restart or reconnect your MCP client - a client reads its server list at startup, and this is the one step `aicb init` cannot do for you.
5. Call `server_info` to confirm the connection. It needs no session, no solution and no build, so it is the cheapest proof that the wiring took.
6. Start asking questions: the agent passes the absolute path of your `.sln` as the session argument (self-init) and works with the semantic tools from then on.

## 2.5 The `.mcp.json` entry

The file is created in the project root if it does not exist, and receives exactly this entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aicb": {
      "command": "aicb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `command` is the bare name of the globally installed tool, not a path, so the entry is portable. The file is written with indentation and a trailing newline, because it is hand-edited and usually kept in version control.

What happens when the file already exists:

| Situation | Line printed by the command |
|---|---|
| No file was there | `created with the aicb entry` |
| File existed, other servers kept, aicb added | `aicb entry added, existing entries kept` |
| An aicb entry existed and `--force` replaced it | `existing aicb entry replaced (--force)` |
| An aicb entry existed, no `--force` | `already has an aicb entry - left untouched` |
| The file cannot be used as a server list | `left untouched - not valid JSON, or a duplicate key, or the top level is not an object, or 'mcpServers' is not an object; fix or remove it and re-run` |

Notes on the refusal:

- It names all four possible causes on purpose, because three of them are valid JSON: a syntax check in your editor does not rule them out.
- The file is parsed strictly - no comments, no trailing commas. A tolerant read followed by a write would silently delete whatever the tolerance swallowed.
- Without `--force` an existing aicb entry is never touched. You may have pointed it at a wrapper script, a debug build or another binary, and silently rewriting that is the one way this command could break a working setup.
- With `--force` the entry is replaced in place, so it stays where you had it and the diff is a single hunk. Your other entries are kept either way, including their exact spelling - non-ASCII characters in unrelated lines are not rewritten.

### Three files with similar names

- `.mcp.json` - the **client's** file, in your project root. The running server never reads it; only `aicb init` reads it, to add its entry.
- `aicb.mcp.json` - **aicb's own** file, optional, in your user configuration directory. It sets the exposed tool set and the session cache for headless operation. Absent is the normal case.
- `<SolutionName>.aicb.json` - the per-solution sidecar next to your `.sln`: layers, exclusions, test detection. It belongs in your repository.

## 2.6 The agent skills

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML front matter that an agent harness loads from `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Its `description` is what an agent sees before deciding whether the skill applies, so it is written as a trigger.

| Skill | Written by | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `aicb-csharp-context` | every run (default) | The manual for driving aicb itself, addressed to the agent |
| `aicb-code-review` | `--skills all` | The correctness half of a post-task review pair: finds bugs |
| `aicb-code-simplifier` | `--skills all` | The complexity half: finds over-engineering, not bugs |
| `aicb-usage-check` | `--skills all` | Reads `usage_report` at the end of a task: what this server was reached for, what went untouched, what it cost |

The names carry the `aicb-` prefix deliberately: `code-review` and `code-simplifier` are already taken in a typical Claude Code installation, and a skill that silently loses to a same-named neighbor is worse than one that is absent, because nothing reports the collision.

The three are opt-in because each is an opinion about how you should work, not part of the product - if you already have a review routine, aicb's should not turn up beside it unasked, and whether you audit your own tool use is your habit to choose.

### What `aicb-csharp-context` tells the agent

- **Setup**: how to install aicb and register the server.
- **Step 0 - the session**: every tool accepts the absolute `.sln` path directly as its session argument (self-init); no separate analyze step is needed, and the server reads live source, including uncommitted work.
- **Which tool answers which question**: a routing table from question to tool.
- **The pre-edit gate**: before any edit that changes a symbol other code names - a rename counts, and so do a signature, a default value or a shared enum, interface or DTO - the first call is `impact_of_change`. The trigger is how far the symbol reaches, not what kind of edit it is. The tool returns the transitive fan-in, including consumers a compile does not check: a count assertion in a test, a non-exhaustive `switch` statement, a parallel list that has to grow with yours.
- **How far to trust an answer**: a rank order of tool groups by how often they misled, with the practical rule that the less a tool is called, the more its answer is a lead rather than a fact.
- **Reading the results**: an empty result is not proof of absence; result lists are capped while the reported totals stay true.
- **After you edit**: `refresh_session` first, then `get_diagnostics`. The order is not cosmetic - `get_diagnostics` compiles the session's snapshot, so without the refresh it describes the code before your edit.
- **Symbol or text**: when plain text search is still the right tool - string literals, comments, log messages, config keys, non-C# files.
- **First run on an unfamiliar solution**: `solution_config_status`, then `init_solution_config` and `apply_solution_config` if a slot is uninitialized.
- **Limits**: C# only; opening a solution runs its MSBuild logic, so analyze only solutions you trust; the fan-in graph covers exactly two markup edge kinds.

### What the review pair tells the agent

Both skills are written as a workflow. They gather the pending diff first (pushed branch, `main`, last commit, plus uncommitted changes), then check their heuristics against aicb facts before judging. If aicb is not connected, both say so explicitly: `aicb-code-review` runs a build itself rather than skipping the checks silently, while `aicb-code-simplifier` works from reading alone.

- `aicb-code-review` runs aicb pre-checks on the changed solution - `refresh_session`, `get_diagnostics`, `impact_of_change` per changed symbol, `find_tests_for` and `coverage_gaps`, concurrency checks for async changes, the markup tools for XAML changes, and `list_insights` for pre-existing smells - and then works through bug classes: logic errors, boundaries, null handling, state and lifecycle, resource leaks, error handling, concurrency, async pitfalls, data integrity and security.
- `aicb-code-simplifier` verifies its heuristics with usage, implementation and dead-code facts and then applies lenses such as unnecessary abstraction, premature generalization, nested control flow that could be flat, dead branches, stale comments and verbose tests.

Both accept a `--high` mode (the default, a single pass) and a `--max` mode (parallel angle-finders for higher recall).

### Where the skills go

Skills are always written to `.claude/skills/`, where Claude Code reads them. When the project uses Codex or OpenCode, or `--hooks` names one of them, the same skills are also written to `.agents/skills/`: Codex reads skills from there and from `.codex/skills/`, OpenCode from there, `.claude/skills/` and `.opencode/skills/`, and both read the shared folder. OpenCode keeps one copy of a skill it finds under two of its folders.

The skill is written per project. If you want it available in every project instead of one, copy the folder `.claude/skills/aicb-csharp-context/` to the same path under your home directory.

## 2.7 The symbol guard

The guard is the enforcement half of the setup: the skills tell an agent what aicb is for, and the hook makes the switch happen whether or not the agent read them. aicb installs **only** this hook - no other hook or plugin of any kind.

It is a Node.js script that the harness runs before a tool call (`PreToolUse` in Claude Code and Codex, `tool.execute.before` in OpenCode). For Claude Code and Codex the wiring starts it with `node`, so Node.js has to be available on your `PATH`. The guard fails open: any error inside it results in "allow", so a broken hook can never break your tools.

### The one thing it refuses

A **Grep** call whose pattern is a single C# symbol - a PascalCase identifier of three or more characters (optionally starting with `I`), or a `Type.Member` pair - is denied. The agent does not get search results; it gets this message:

```text
aicb-guard: this is a C# SYMBOL query (pattern='<pattern>'). grep misses overloads,
aliasing, partial types and interface dispatch - use the semantic MCP tools instead:
mcp__aicb__find_usages (who uses X) / find_symbol (where is X) / explain_symbol (what is
X) / calls_external (external BCL/NuGet member) / impact_of_change (blast radius). No
separate analyze step needed: pass the .sln directly as sessionId (sessionId="<abs path
to .sln>") and the tool self-initializes. If this is genuinely a TEXT search (string
literal / comment / log / config), restrict it to the file type (Grep glob e.g. "*.xaml"
or "*.md") or open the specific file with Read.
```

This is the only hard block. A shell command is never hard-blocked, because a shell command can do anything - `Bash` calls that look like a symbol sweep only get a note.

Note: the message names the tools in the `mcp__aicb__...` form that Claude Code uses. Other harnesses may present the same tools without that prefix; the agent should use whatever form its own tool list shows.

### What it only warns about

| What the agent does | What the guard does |
|---|---|
| `Grep` with a multi-name alternation (`A\|B\|C`), every branch symbol-shaped | Allows, with a note: no MCP tool accepts a multi-name pattern, and the one-call semantic form is `batch` with several `find_usages` sub-queries |
| `Grep` with a mixed alternation (symbol-shaped and plain-text branches) | Allows, with a note naming the symbol branches |
| `Bash` with `grep`, `rg` or `findstr` on a symbol-shaped pattern | Allows, with a note preferring the semantic tools |
| First `Edit`, `Write` or `MultiEdit` on a `.cs` file in a session | Allows, with a reminder to run `impact_of_change` first and `refresh_session` + `get_diagnostics` after |
| Codex `apply_patch` touching a `.cs` file | The same reminder, once per session (shared with the edit reminder) |
| `Read` of a file of 50 KB or more without `offset`/`limit` | Allows, with a note to read a slice instead - once per session |
| `Read` of a file of 100 KB or more without `offset`/`limit` | The same note, every time |
| `dotnet build` or `dotnet test` | Allows, with a note that `refresh_session` + `get_diagnostics` pre-checks compile errors without a build - once per session |

Everything except the refusal is a non-blocking reminder. Only the refusal prevents anything; the reminders cost a little context and nothing else.

### When the guard stays silent

- **No `*.sln` directly in the project directory** - the guard is completely quiet in a non-.NET project or in a directory that only contains sub-projects.
- **A search scoped away from C#** - a non-C# `glob` or `type` (for example `*.xaml`, `*.md`, `*.json`), or a `path` that points at one concrete file. A file-scoped search is a targeted text scan, not a codebase-wide symbol sweep.
- **A pattern with regex structure** - groups, character classes, quantifier braces (`()[]{}`) or `=>`. Such a pattern is a text search, never a bare symbol query.
- **Plain text by shape** - all-lowercase or snake_case names, UPPER_SNAKE constant or config keys, phrases containing spaces, paths and version strings are not symbol-shaped and pass through.

If you are blocked on a genuine text search, the same two routes work: restrict the search to a file type, or open the file with `Read`.

### Marker files

To keep the once-per-session notes from repeating on every call, the guard writes small marker files:

- Location: `<project>/<harness directory>/cache/nudge-<session>-<key>` - for example `.claude/cache/` for Claude Code, `.codex/cache/` for Codex, `.opencode/cache/` for OpenCode.
- Keys: `edit-cs`, `read-big`, `dotnet-build`.

The harness directory is derived from the guard's own location, so a guard installed for OpenCode never creates a `.claude/` directory in a project that has never run Claude Code.

Note: these marker files are harmless and can be deleted at any time; the guard recreates them as needed. `aicb init` does not add a `.gitignore` entry for the folder, so add one yourself if you do not want them in version control.

### Installing it for a harness deliberately

`--hooks auto` installs for the harnesses it detects. To install for a specific one regardless of detection, name it: `--hooks claude-code`, `--hooks codex`, `--hooks opencode`, or `--hooks all` for all three. To install nothing, use `--hooks none` - the rest of the run (the `.mcp.json` entry and the skills) still happens.

## 2.8 Harness detection with `--hooks auto`

`auto` is the default because writing enforcement for a harness a project does not use is not neutral: it drops configuration files into a repository you would then have to explain.

Detection asks whether a **marker directory** exists in the project - `.claude/`, `.codex/` or `.opencode/`. A marker counts as evidence when it contains at least one entry that `aicb init` itself would not have written there, because `init` creates `.claude/skills/` on every run and must not read its own side effect as proof that Claude Code is in use. Two boundary cases are deliberate:

- An **empty** marker directory counts as evidence.
- A non-empty marker counts only when it has at least one child that aicb does not create itself. For `.codex/`, `hooks/` and `cache/` are self-created; for `.opencode/`, `plugins/` and `cache/` are self-created. A marker containing only those children therefore does not count.

The price of this rule is a false negative in the safe direction: if your `.claude/` directory contains only your own `skills/` folder, `auto` does not recognize Claude Code. You then get the explicit line

```text
No agent harness detected here, so no symbol guard was installed and this run registered the server only in .mcp.json (read by Claude Code). Pass --hooks claude-code|codex|opencode (or --hooks all) to wire one anyway - for Codex and OpenCode that also registers the server in their own config.
```

and install it yourself with `--hooks claude-code`. Nothing is installed unasked.

## 2.9 What a run reports

Each artifact gets one line in the format `<label> <path> - <detail>`, with the labels padded to equal width:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `created` | The file did not exist and was written |
| `updated` | An existing file was changed (an added or replaced entry, or a `--force` replacement) |
| `kept` | The file was already in the desired state and was left untouched |
| `refused` | The file was not touched, because touching it could have destroyed something |

A sample run in a Claude Code project:

```text
created  C:\work\MyApp\.mcp.json - created with the aicb entry
created  C:\work\MyApp\.claude\skills\aicb-csharp-context\SKILL.md - agent skill aicb-csharp-context written
created  C:\work\MyApp\.claude\hooks\aicb-symbol-guard.mjs - aicb symbol guard written
created  C:\work\MyApp\.claude\settings.json - Claude Code: created with the aicb symbol guard wired

The symbol guard is installed and it BLOCKS: a C# symbol search is refused and redirected to the aicb tools, not merely discouraged. Worth knowing before it surprises you.
  Remove it for Claude Code: delete the aicb entry from C:\work\MyApp\.claude\settings.json
  Skip it next time: aicb init --hooks none (that writes no enforcement - it does not remove what is already there).

Restart or reconnect your MCP client, then call server_info to confirm it took.
```

The paragraph after the file list appears only when the run actually installed a guard. It says three things: that the guard blocks rather than discourages, how to remove it (naming the actual wiring file), and that `--hooks none` governs the **next** run rather than undoing an installation.

In a Codex project the run also registers the server and writes the skill a second time:

```text
created  C:\work\MyApp\.mcp.json - created with the aicb entry
created  C:\work\MyApp\.codex\config.toml - Codex CLI server list: created with the aicb entry
created  C:\work\MyApp\.claude\skills\aicb-csharp-context\SKILL.md - agent skill aicb-csharp-context written
created  C:\work\MyApp\.agents\skills\aicb-csharp-context\SKILL.md - agent skill aicb-csharp-context written
created  C:\work\MyApp\.codex\hooks\aicb-symbol-guard.mjs - aicb symbol guard written
created  C:\work\MyApp\.codex\hooks.json - Codex CLI: created with the aicb symbol guard wired
```

and ends, after the guard paragraph, with the step only you can take:

```text
Codex reads .codex/config.toml only in a project it trusts. Open Codex in this folder once and trust it, or the aicb entry stays invisible to it.
```

For OpenCode the server entry goes into `opencode.json` (`OpenCode server list: created with the aicb entry`), the file that also carries its guard wiring.

If more than one `aicb` is on your `PATH`, every run also prints a warning, because each MCP client starts the **first** one and updating another one changes nothing a client runs:

```text
warning: "aicb" is installed 2 times. Every MCP client starts the FIRST one; updating another one changes nothing a client runs.
  runs    C:\Program Files\AIContextBuilder\cli\aicb.exe - Windows installer (AI Context Builder)
  ignored C:\Users\you\.dotnet\tools\aicb.exe - .NET tool (dotnet tool install -g aicb-roslyn-mcp)
  Keep one. With the desktop app: keep the installer and run 'dotnet tool uninstall -g aicb-roslyn-mcp' (installed before 0.5.465.11: 'dotnet tool uninstall -g AIContextBuilder'). Without it: uninstall "AI Context Builder" in Windows Settings > Apps.
```

The run ends with the step it cannot take for you:

```text
Restart or reconnect your MCP client, then call server_info to confirm it took.
```

Exit codes: `0` on success, `1` if `--hooks` was invalid, the target directory did not exist, or at least one artifact was refused (`error: nothing was written for at least one artefact (see above).`).

## 2.10 Turning the guard off, or removing it

- **Install nothing next time**: `aicb init --hooks none`. This writes no enforcement, but it does not remove an installation that is already there.
- **Remove an installed guard**: delete the aicb entry from your harness's own configuration file - `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json` or `opencode.json`. For Claude Code and Codex this is the `PreToolUse` entry whose command names `aicb-symbol-guard.mjs`; for OpenCode it is the plugin entry `./.opencode/plugins/aicb-symbol-guard.ts`. Every run that installs a guard prints the path of the file to edit.
- **Remove the files as well** (optional): the guard script(s) under `.claude/hooks/`, `.codex/hooks/` or `.opencode/plugins/`, and the `cache/` marker directory.
- **Keep an edited guard**: an existing guard script is never overwritten without `--force`, exactly because a customized exemption list is the most likely thing to lose. The same holds for an existing wiring entry.

## 2.11 What this means for your agent workflow

After a default `aicb init` in a Claude Code project, the following changes for the agent working in that project:

1. A `Grep` search for a C# symbol name is **refused**, and the agent is redirected to the aicb tool that answers the question properly.
2. An `Edit`, `Write` or `MultiEdit` on a `.cs` file produces a one-time-per-session reminder to run `impact_of_change` before the change.
3. A `Read` of a file of 50 KB or more without a slice produces a reminder once per session; at 100 KB or more, every time.
4. `dotnet build` or `dotnet test` produces a one-time-per-session reminder about the faster diagnostics path.
5. The project gains a `cache/` folder with marker files under the harness directory.
6. The agent has the `aicb-csharp-context` skill available, whose description makes it load on any C# symbol question.

Only the first point prevents something. The others cost a little context and nothing else. The files land in your project, so you can commit them to share the setup with everyone working on the repository.

### What the server tells your agent

Independently of the installation, the server reports the wiring state to the calling agent. The report exists only when there is something to say: when the harness is wired, the field is absent and the answer is byte-for-byte unchanged.

- **Wired**: no hint.
- **Recognized harness, not wired**: the agent is told the project does not wire the guard for its harness, that the guard turns the rule from advice into enforcement, and how to install it - with `aicb init --hooks <id>` or the `install_agent_hooks` tool - followed by the rule in words.
- **Unrecognized client, or a client that announced no name**: the agent is told that aicb ships wirings for Claude Code, Codex CLI and OpenCode and has none for it, and it is given the rule in words. On such a harness the sentence itself is the mechanism.

The hint travels as a JSON field `agentWiring` on the session information and as a leading Markdown comment `<!-- aicb agent wiring: ... -->` on raw-Markdown answers such as `get_context` and `architecture_overview`, which cannot carry a JSON field.

### Installing from inside an agent: `install_agent_hooks`

The MCP tool `install_agent_hooks` is the second entry point for the guard. It writes **only** the guard script and the wiring entry - no `.mcp.json` and no skills - and it is the one aicb tool that writes into your project's agent configuration on request.

| Parameter | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | yes | A session id, or the absolute `.sln` / `.slnx` / `.slnf` path (self-init) |
| `harness` | no | `claude-code`, `codex` or `opencode`. Omit it to use the harness the calling MCP client belongs to. An unknown name, or an unnamed client with no `harness` argument, is refused with the list of known ids |
| `force` | no | Overwrite an existing guard script and rewrite an existing wiring entry (default `false`) |

There is no path parameter: the target directory is the one holding the solution the `sessionId` resolves to. The response reports the harness, the project directory, whether the run succeeded, one entry per artifact (path, outcome, detail), and the step the caller has to take next:

```text
Restart or reconnect the MCP client so it loads the new wiring, then call refresh_session to clear the agentWiring hint on this session.
```

The two staleness windows it names are different: the client reads its configuration at startup, and the session keeps its analyze-time answer until it is refreshed. Installing hooks writes no source file, so a `refresh_session` alone is enough to clear the hint - no re-analysis is needed.

Note: `install_agent_hooks` is not available through `batch` or `measure`, so a call an agent believes is a read can never perform an installation.

### The built-in manual

The server also carries its own manual as the `docs` tool. `docs()` without arguments returns the directory with a token estimate per page; `docs("install")` returns the page that mirrors this chapter from inside the agent, and the route `docs("init")` returns the whole first-run sequence in reading order. It is a useful answer when an agent asks how aicb is set up in a project it cannot see.
