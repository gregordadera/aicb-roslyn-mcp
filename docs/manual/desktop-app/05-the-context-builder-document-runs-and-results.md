# 5 The Context Builder: document, runs and results

The Context Builder is the workspace in which a loaded solution becomes a context document. It is where you decide what goes into the document, how the document is shaped and where you send it to a model - and where you read what the model answered. Each solution you open gets its own tab; the tab header shows the solution file name and appends ` *` while there are unsaved changes.

The workspace has three fixed parts:

- the **global header** above everything: solution identity with `Open`, the `Max MD size` budget, the mode chips, and the run-template group with the run actions;
- the **Solution Tree** in the left sidebar - the scope selector for everything you render. It can be collapsed to a slim rail; its width is remembered;
- the **tab area** on the right: the configuration panels, the document, the model response and the run views.

## 5.1 Finding your way

Which tabs and panels are visible depends on the five mode chips in the header (`Selection`, `Format`, `LLM`, `Review`, `Run`); they are described in "The Context Builder: layout and solution tree". `Details` and `MD Input` are always visible. `Reasoning` and `Active Run`, described below, need the `Run` chip.

## 5.2 The run template and the run actions

The run-template group of the header carries two selectors and three actions.

- `Run Template` - selects the run template for this tab. Picking one switches the active context template, reloads the prompt fields from it and fills `Goal / Task (User Prompt)` from the template - but only while that field is still empty; text you have typed is never overwritten. The current view shows no confirmation message for this switch. If the run template names a context template that was deleted after the run template was saved, the switch is skipped: the active context template stays in place, and the run template itself is not changed. The Sections and Selection Engine source lines then name the active template as a stand-in, for example `From active context template 'X' - run template 'Y' names a deleted one`. The view shows no message for this either.
- `LLM` - selects the model-profile override for subsequent sends from this tab. The first entry carries a `Default` badge and stands for the standard resolution order (model pinned by the run template → profile marked as default → first profile). The choice remains active until you select another entry, close the tab or restart the application.

| Action | What it does | Shortcut |
|---|---|---|
| `Export whole Solution` | Renders the entire solution into `MD Input`, ignoring the tree selection. | - |
| `Generate MD` | Renders the current tree selection into `MD Input` - the same action as `Create MD` on the `MD Input` tab. | Ctrl+M |
| `Generate & Send MD` | Renders the current selection and sends it immediately. | Ctrl+Enter |

Below the actions, `Recent runs:` shows up to three chips for the most recent runs of the current session (run number, name, run type, status, time). The row is hidden while there are none.

## 5.3 The `MD Input` tab - the generated document

This is where every render lands. Its tooltip reads `The generated markdown context - review or edit it, then send it to the LLM.`

A permanently visible warning banner sits above the document: `Manual edits in this markdown are preserved for the next send but will be overwritten on the next 'Create MD' / 'Generate & Send MD'.`

Below the banner a card reports what the document contains:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `Created from current selection` | fixed label |
| selection summary | `N Project(s) | N Files | N Types | N Methods` |
| token estimate | `~12,400 tokens` - measured with the tokenizer of the resolved model profile (fallback: the default tokenizer). When the notation rewrite produced a different size than the tag baseline, the baseline is added: `~12,400 tokens (Tag: ~10,900)` |
| graphs | the graph sections actually present in the document, as short labels joined with ` + ` (for example `Architecture + Service + Layer`); `-` when the document contains none |
| code mode | `Enabled` or `None` - whether any node contributed source code |

The document itself is an editable AvalonEdit text editor with word wrap, a monospace font and a permanently visible scrollbar. It shows no line numbers, and URLs in it are not turned into links. Your edits are taken over when the editor loses focus, not on every keystroke, so a large whole-solution document stays responsive. The right-click menu offers Cut, Copy and Paste.

### The buttons under the document

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| `Create MD` | Regenerates the document from the current tree selection and the panel settings - no API call. Tooltip: `Generates the MD output from the current Tree selection + Template settings - no API call. The text can then be edited and 'Send to API' pressed. (Ctrl+M)` |
| `Copy to Clipboard` | `Copies the current MD input text to the clipboard (e.g. for manual pasting into an external LLM tool).` |
| `Save as…` | `Writes the current MD input text to a .md file you pick. Disabled while there is nothing to save.` |
| `Send to API` | `Sends the current MD input to the active LLM (or the Override-selected one). The response appears in the 'LLM Response' tab.` |
| `Cancel` | Visible while a request is running: `Aborts the running LLM request - the server may still finish computing, but the response is discarded.` |
| `Pause` | Visible while a request is running: `Pauses the iterative Run after the current step (Iteration Run Templates only).` |
| `Resume` | Visible while a run is paused: `Resumes a paused iterative Run.` |

To the right of the buttons the status line reports the progress and the result of the last action.

`Save as…` opens a save dialog titled `Save context document` with the filter `Markdown files (*.md)|*.md|All files (*.*)|*.*`. The suggested name is derived from the loaded solution - `<SolutionName>-context.md` - so a folder of saved documents does not end up as a pile of files all called `context.md`. On success the status line reads `Context document saved to <path>`; on failure it reads `Save failed: <message>`.

### The `LLM Response` tab

The response to the last send. The text box is editable, and the buttons below it are:

- `Copy to Clipboard` - `Copies the LLM output to the clipboard. (Ctrl+Shift+C)`.
- `Use as MD input` - `Copies the LLM output into the markdown input (tab 'MD Input') so a follow-up run can iterate on the previous answer.` The view switches to `MD Input` and the status line confirms with `LLM output copied to MD input.` The button is disabled while the response is empty.

### What happens when you press `Send to API`

A send runs in phases, and each phase has a visible outcome in the status line.

**Preflight.** The send is validated before anything is transmitted. A failed preflight writes `Send failed: ` plus the reason:

| Situation | Message |
|---|---|
| the document is empty | `no markdown to send. Run Create MD first.` |
| no model profile exists | `no model profiles defined. Settings > Model Profiles.` |
| an API profile has no key | `API key for model '<name>' is missing. Settings > Model Profiles.` |
| no executor for the run type | `RunType '<type>' is not supported. Only Manual, Iteration and Preselection runs can be started.` |
| an iterative run without a loaded solution | `no solution loaded.` |
| an iterative run without selected nodes | `no <granularity>-nodes selected in the tree. Mark some nodes first.` |

**Budget confirmation.** For `Iteration` and `Preselection` runs (not yet released, see "Run types: what is released") a cost estimate runs before the send and a dialog can warn that the configured node cap would be exceeded. If you decline that dialog, nothing happens - no request is sent and no status message is written.

**Auto-session.** When a solution is loaded, every run is stored with a session. If the tab has no session yet, one named `Untitled` is created automatically so the run is persisted; the status line appends ` · Auto-session 'Untitled ...' created - rename it via the Sessions tab.` You can rename it later on the `Sessions` tab (see "Workspace, sessions and snapshots"). Without a loaded solution, the run can still execute, but no auto-session or snapshot is created and the status reports `(not persisted - open a solution first)`.

**Execution with streaming.** The status line shows `Sending to <model> ...`. For a manual run the answer streams live into `LLM Response`, and the view switches there with the first chunk.

**Completion.** On success the status line reads `Done. <model> · <ok>/<total> nodes · in <n> / out <m> tokens`, followed by the auto-session note when one was created. A manual run leaves you on `LLM Response`. On failure it reads `Send failed: <reason>`.

**Post-processing.** The answer is then examined for thinking blocks, tool calls, findings and an evaluation; the `Reasoning` tab is reloaded for the finished run and the `Recent runs:` row is refreshed.

While a request is running, `Cancel` and `Pause` are available. `Cancel` writes `Cancelling ...`, `Pause` writes `Pausing at next step boundary ...`. `Resume` continues a paused iterative run and reports `Resumed run completed. <ok>/<total> nodes.` (or `Paused again at step boundary.` / `Resume failed: <reason>`).

Note: A `Manual` run has no pre-flight cost estimate - it starts as soon as you press the button. The confirmation dialog exists only for `Iteration` and `Preselection`.

## 5.4 The `Reasoning` tab - what the model did

The `Reasoning` tab shows a finished run branch by branch. It requires the `Run` mode chip.

The header shows the run's name and its status. On the left, `Branches` lists the steps the run was split into; each entry shows the branch name and, as a subtitle, its token usage and latency (`in <n> / out <m> tokens · <ms> ms`) or the error message if the branch failed. Empty state: `No run analyzed yet. Branches appear after a run completes.`

For the selected branch there are six sub-tabs. A small dot in a tab header marks that the selected branch has content for that sub-tab.

![The Reasoning tab: branches on the left, the model output of the selected branch on the right](img/gui-reasoning.png)

| Sub-tab | Content | Empty state |
|---|---|---|
| `Output` | the raw model output, read-only | - |
| `Thinking` | the model's thinking blocks | `No thinking blocks in this step. Thinking is requested through the system prompt, and the model answers with <thinking>...</thinking> tags - a model that does not use them produces no blocks here.` |
| `Tool Calls` | the tool-use calls parsed from the answer | `No tool calls in this step. Tool calls are read from <tool_use>...</tool_use> tags in the model's answer.` |
| `Findings` | findings parsed from the answer, filterable by severity | `No findings to show. Either this step produced none, or the severity filters above are hiding them.` |
| `Evaluation` | `Hypothesis`, `Actual result`, `Score`, `Quality` and `Notes` | `No evaluation in this run. The parser looks for Hypothesis / Result / Score / Quality sections in the LLM output.` |
| `Changes` | files the answer proposed a new state for, diffed against the working tree | `No diff to show. A diff appears when the answer states the full content of a file it changed and that file is found in the loaded solution - which is what the Code Change prompt asks for.` |

**Findings here are not the Insights.** The `Findings` sub-tab shows what the model itself reported in its answer, sorted into the four severity categories `Critical`, `Warning`, `OK` and `Info` (the answer marks them as `**Critical:**`, `**Warning:**`, `**OK:**` and `**Info:**`). All four filters are on when the tab opens; clear a filter to hide that severity. The separate `Insights` tab (mode chip `Review`) is about your code, not about the answer - it holds the application's own code-quality heuristics for the loaded solution. Two different sources, two different tabs.

### `Changes` - the proposed file states

Above the file list a summary line states how many files the answer proposed and how many were resolved against the working tree: `<n> file(s) proposed, <m> resolved against the working tree.` If the answer did not use the expected block form, the summary says so instead: `This answer states no file content in the applicable form. The Code Change prompt is the one that asks for it.`

A proposed path that cannot be shown as a diff is named together with its reason:

| State | Displayed text |
|---|---|
| no solution loaded | `No solution loaded - the path cannot be resolved.` |
| resolved | the absolute path |
| ambiguous | `Ambiguous - <n> files of this solution match this path.` |
| found, unreadable | `Found but unreadable: <path>` |
| too large | `Too large to show as a diff: <path>` |
| not found | `No file of this solution matches this path.` |

Selecting a file shows a unified diff between the file on disk and the state the answer proposed. When the two are identical, the diff pane says `(No line-level changes; the proposed content matches the file on disk.)` Malformed blocks are reported in warning color above the list - for example an unterminated block (usually the answer hit its output limit mid-file), a block without a path, empty content, a path named twice, a stray closing marker, or content wrapped in a Markdown fence (stripped, so the file is still usable).

Note: The `Changes` sub-tab is a view only. There is no button that applies a proposed change; to edit a file and write it back, use the `Details` tab.

## 5.5 The `Active Run` tab - progress while a run is running

The `Active Run` tab requires the `Run` mode chip. Its header carries the title `Active Run`, the run name and the model, a run-type pill and a status pill that switches between `Running` and `Complete`.

| Display | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Step <n> / <m>` with a progress bar | the current step of the run |
| `OK <n>` | successfully completed steps |
| `Failed <n>` | failed steps |
| `<n> in / <m> out` | input and output tokens of the whole run |

The step list shows one row per step: its number (`#1`), its name, a status pill (`Pending`, `Running`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, `Skipped`) and the step's own token count as `<in>/<out>` (tooltip `Input / output tokens of this step.`). The status is also color-coded on the dot in front of each row.

Select a step to read what it streamed: a pane under the list titled `Live output · <step>` shows the model output that step produced, with the tooltip `Model output streamed by this step. Select text to copy.` The first output of a run opens this pane automatically; after that your own selection decides.

![The Active Run tab during a multi-step run](img/gui-active-run.png)

Empty state: `No run started yet. Steps appear here as soon as a run is running.`

Note: Only `Manual` runs are released, and a manual run is a single request - it appears here as one step named after the run. The multi-step view is what an iterative run will show once it is released.

## 5.6 Token, cost and progress displays

| Where | Display | Updated by |
|---|---|---|
| Header | `Max MD size` (target tokens) and `Overshoot %` | your input |
| Header | `+X% over budget` - how far the last document actually exceeded the target; empty when within budget | the last render |
| `MD Input` header | token estimate, selection summary, active graphs, code mode | the last render |
| `MD Input` status line | `Done. <model> · <ok>/<total> nodes · in <n> / out <m> tokens` | the end of a send |
| `Active Run` | step counter, OK/Failed, tokens in total and per step | live progress |
| Load overlay | a percentage plus a detail line such as `142 / 318 files` | solution analysis progress |
| Export overlay | an indeterminate ring plus `Rendering whole solution...` | a whole-solution render |
| `Sections` panel | `<n> slots populated | <n> empty | <n> run overrides` | slot changes |
| `Graph Selection` panel | `<n> of <m> selected` | checkbox changes |
| Tree sidebar | selection provenance and `<n> overrides` | your tree edits |

Note: Token counts are always available. A pre-flight dialog also shows `Estimated cost: $X.XX USD` when input and output prices have been entered on the selected model profile; without those prices, no cost is shown.

## 5.7 From solution to context document, step by step

The following walkthrough follows the five decision points that measurably change the result: scope, detail and sections, prompt, budget, and the way the document leaves the application.

### 1. Choose the scope

Check the nodes that belong in the document in the Solution Tree and, where needed, set a detail level with the chip at the end of a row. `Auto-compress` in the tree toolbar sets a sensible level for every method in one click; `MD content only` shows exactly what will end up in the document. Details: "The Context Builder: layout and solution tree".

### 2. Shape detail, sections and graphs

With the `Selection` and `Format` chips on, the `Main` tab offers the `Selection Engine` (detail preset and expansion strategy per detail level), `Sections` (a tag schema per text section, or none), `Graph Selection` (which of the ten graphs to include) and `Export Output` (`Tag` or `YAML` notation). All of them have usable defaults from the run template. Selection Engine and Sections overrides are stored with the session; Graph Selection and the Tag/YAML choice are reloaded from the run template when the session is opened or the template changes and are not session-persisted. Details: "The Context Builder: configuration panels and code editor".

### 3. Write the prompt

With the `LLM` chip on, the `Prompt` panel holds the five fields that are sent with the document: `System Role` and `Instructions` come from the context template's prompt record, `Goal / Task (User Prompt)`, `Constraints / Rules` and `Additional Context` are yours and are stored with the session. The goal is the one field you normally fill in.

### 4. Set the budget

`Max MD size` in the header caps the document (8,000 to 200,000 tokens, default 60,000, and the value you set is kept across restarts); `No limit` switches the cap off, and `Overshoot:` sets the tolerated headroom above the target. The renderer converges on the target by lowering detail and dropping the least relevant content, never by cutting a block in half; `+X% over budget` reports what the last render actually used.

### 5. Render the document

| Action | Scope | Shortcut |
|---|---|---|
| `Create MD` (on `MD Input`) | the current tree selection plus all panel settings | Ctrl+M |
| `Generate MD` (in the header) | the same render, from the same selection | Ctrl+M |
| `Export whole Solution` (in the header) | the entire solution, ignoring the tree selection and needing no analysis run | - |
| `Generate & Send MD` (in the header) | renders the current selection and sends it immediately | Ctrl+Enter |

All of them write their result to the same place: the document in `MD Input`, and the view switches there.

Details of `Export whole Solution`:

- The heavy render runs off the UI thread. A dimmed overlay with a spinner and the text `Rendering whole solution...` blocks the workspace until it is done, and the window stays responsive.
- The solution is already analyzed, so this does not analyze it again.
- A second click while a render is running is ignored.
- The button has no disabled state: a missing solution or a missing context template is reported in the status line instead - `No solution loaded - open a solution first.` or `No active context template - cannot render the whole solution.` A render error is reported as `Export failed: <message>`.
- It does not change your tree selection.

### 6. Get the document out

You have three ways out of the application:

- **`Save as…`** on the `MD Input` tab writes the document to the `.md` file you choose.
- **`Copy to Clipboard`** copies it for pasting into another tool.
- **`Send to API`** (or `Generate & Send MD`) sends it to the configured model and shows the answer in `LLM Response`.

### 7. Save your work

The tree state is expensive to reconstruct, so the workspace tracks unsaved changes and marks the tab header with ` *` while there are any. Three situations ask you to save: the explicit save command, closing a tab, and closing the window.

- **`Save Session`** in the tab bar (Ctrl+S) saves the current tab as a session. The dialog is pre-filled with a name of the form `<SolutionName> - <date> <time>` and the notes of an existing session. If the state is unchanged since the last save, a dialog asks whether to overwrite anyway. If the chosen name already exists for this solution, a dialog offers to save anyway or to go back and pick another name. On success a message confirms `Session "<name>" saved.` (or `updated.`) together with the number of selected nodes and the active template.
- **Closing a tab** (Ctrl+W, or the close button on the tab) with unsaved changes asks `Save before closing?`. `Yes` saves all unsaved sessions in the tab - if one save fails or is cancelled, the tab stays open. `No` discards the changes. `Cancel` aborts the close. The question can be switched off with the `Tab-close confirmation` setting under Settings → General; clearing that setting makes such a tab close straight away and discard its unsaved edits.
- **Closing the application** always asks, whatever the `Tab-close confirmation` setting says, because one unasked confirmation would discard every unsaved session at once.

**Auto-save** persists your work in the background. It is on by default and saves every 5 minutes; `Auto-save enabled` and `Auto-save interval (minutes)` under Settings → General configure the timer (values below one minute are raised to one), but changes take effect only after the next application start. Auto-save skips only tabs without a session ID; the `Untitled ...` session created by a first send is included even if it was never named through the dialog. If an auto-save fails, a warning appears once per session: `Auto-save could not save one of your open sessions. Your changes remain unsaved, and other tabs will continue to auto-save. Use Save Session to retry and see any detailed error.`

**Two access points and one lock.** The `+` button in the tab bar opens another solution tab (`New Solution tab (Ctrl+N)`), and `Save Session` sits next to it. The host carries three shortcuts: Ctrl+S saves the session, Ctrl+N opens a new tab, Ctrl+W closes the current tab. While a run is active in any tab, the whole tab bar is disabled so you cannot switch tabs and lose the run state - clicks on it simply do nothing until the run has finished.

## 5.8 Run types: what is released

| Run type | Status |
|---|---|
| `Manual` | Released. One request over the current document. This is the type you select in the workspace. |
| `Iteration` | Not yet released. One request per selected node; the executors are wired, but the type cannot be selected yet. |
| `Preselection` | Not yet released, same as `Iteration`. |

The `Run Template` selector lists every template, but only templates of type `Manual` can be chosen; the other entries are shown disabled with a tooltip explaining that they are not released yet. The entry that is already selected stays selectable regardless of its type, so you can always return to it.

Because only `Manual` runs are released, the `Active Run` tab normally shows a single step. Manual runs do not use the cost-threshold confirmation, but a pre-flight dialog can still appear when the selected model profile defines a context window and the request would exceed it.
