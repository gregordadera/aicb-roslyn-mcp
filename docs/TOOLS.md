# Tool reference

Generated from the `tools/list` answer of `aicb 0.5.501.1` with the default
profile - the **54 tools** an agent sees after `aicb init`. Further tools are
one profile switch away (`aicb mcp --mcp-profile mcp-profile/full`); `list_skills` shows
the complete map, and the `docs` tool is the server's built-in manual.

Every tool that takes a `sessionId` also accepts the absolute path of a `.sln`, `.slnx` or
`.slnf` there and analyzes it on first use.

## Overview

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| [`analyze_solution`](#analyze_solution) | Analyze a C#/.NET solution (.sln, .slnx or .slnf) with Roslyn and cache the result as an in-memory session - the entry point of this server: it returns the session_id the other tools take as sessionId.

Calling it is optional: every tool that takes a sessionId also accepts the absolute solution path and analyzes on first use, so do not call it just to run a query. |
| [`apply_solution_config`](#apply_solution_config) | Apply a proposed Layer Profile + Exclude-Namespaces + Test Profile configuration for a solution. |
| [`architecture_overview`](#architecture_overview) | Orient on a whole solution WITHOUT the firewall of full source. |
| [`assert_absence`](#assert_absence) | Check a NEGATIVE claim against the analyzed model and return confirmed / refuted / indeterminate with evidence. |
| [`batch`](#batch) | Run several read-only query tools in ONE round-trip against one shared session. |
| [`call_graph`](#call_graph) | Build a depth-limited call graph rooted at a method NAME. |
| [`calls_external`](#calls_external) | Find the code that calls an EXTERNAL member - BCL or package - whose key contains a pattern. |
| [`check_solution_config_drift`](#check_solution_config_drift) | Check whether a solution's active Layer Profile, Exclude-Namespaces and Test Profile still FIT the code. |
| [`compare_with_previous`](#compare_with_previous) | Diff the current session against a previously saved snapshot of the SAME solution - the newest by default, or the N-th previous via snapshotsBack (0=newest saved, 1=the one before, ...). |
| [`coverage_gaps`](#coverage_gaps) | List what is NOT covered in a scope: 'uncovered' - production methods no test code calls directly - and 'verifiedAbsent' - semantic axes a developer explicitly declared as 'none'. |
| [`describe_api_surface`](#describe_api_surface) | List the PUBLIC API SURFACE of a solution or namespace - every externally-visible type with its externally-visible members (constructors, properties, fields, methods, user-defined operators), each as a compact declaration signature. |
| [`detect_circular_dependencies`](#detect_circular_dependencies) | Detect circular NAMESPACE dependencies: groups of namespaces that depend on each other in a cycle - a modularity smell the compiler allows, unlike project-reference cycles. |
| [`docs`](#docs) | The aicb operating manual - how to USE this server, as opposed to what it can tell you about your code. |
| [`evaluate_change_set`](#evaluate_change_set) | Advisory policy gate: which code-quality / design-smell / layer-violation findings would this edit INTRODUCE? Ask BEFORE writing it. |
| [`explain_symbol`](#explain_symbol) | Explain a symbol: its source PLUS a chosen environment, as ONE dense AI-Builder-Markdown slice - the cold-read in a single call instead of 4-6 (get_context + find_usages + find_implementations + find_tests_for + ...). |
| [`export_markdown`](#export_markdown) | Render the cached analysis of a session as AI-Builder Markdown. |
| [`find_binding_usages`](#find_binding_usages) | List the {Binding ...} sites in the solution's .xaml and .axaml markup that name a member path, with what each one resolves against. |
| [`find_by_attribute`](#find_by_attribute) | Find symbols (types, methods, properties or fields) that carry a given ATTRIBUTE - a cross-cutting query that find_symbol (name-only) cannot do. |
| [`find_by_event_subscription`](#find_by_event_subscription) | Find the TYPES that subscribe to a C# event: a '+=' whose left side resolves to an event, anywhere in the type (constructor, method, accessor, lambda). |
| [`find_by_semantics`](#find_by_semantics) | Find types and methods by their resolved semantics: layer, role, domain, responsibility. |
| [`find_by_side_effects`](#find_by_side_effects) | Find code by its side-effect profile: what a method touches in the outside world. |
| [`find_dead_code`](#find_dead_code) | List dead-code suspects on two axes. |
| [`find_implementations`](#find_implementations) | List the types that implement an interface, whether the interface is declared in the solution or external (IDisposable, IEquatable). |
| [`find_overrides`](#find_overrides) | List the override-to-base relationships for methods of a given name - the class-inheritance counterpart to find_implementations (which covers interfaces). |
| [`find_resource_usages`](#find_resource_usages) | Resource-key fan-in across the solution's XAML/AXAML markup AND its C# sources - the question the C# symbol graph cannot answer because resources are wired by string key, not by symbol. |
| [`find_symbol`](#find_symbol) | Find types, methods, properties, fields, events, enum members and operators whose name contains the query (case-insensitive). |
| [`find_tests_for`](#find_tests_for) | Find the test cases that likely cover a symbol: test methods that call it, read it, build it or are named after it. |
| [`find_unresolved_bindings`](#find_unresolved_bindings) | List silently broken XAML bindings: a {Binding X} whose root member does NOT exist on its confidently resolved DataContext view-model (typo, removed/renamed member, or wrong DataContext) - the defect class that NEITHER the compiler NOR render-smoke tests catch.

Use it after renaming or removing view-model members. |
| [`find_usages`](#find_usages) | List who uses a symbol: its direct fan-in in the solution. |
| [`get_context`](#get_context) | Return a dense, token-budgeted AI-Builder-Markdown slice of the code around a symbol: the symbol's source plus its expanded neighborhood (direct dependencies + callees, depth 1). |
| [`get_diagnostics`](#get_diagnostics) | Compiler errors and warnings without a build: every C# project of the session is compiled in memory, in seconds. |
| [`get_insight`](#get_insight) | Get the full detail of one insight (incl. |
| [`get_type_hierarchy`](#get_type_hierarchy) | Walk one type's inheritance in both directions: baseChain upward, derivedTypes downward, plus the interfaces the type declares. |
| [`impact_of_change`](#impact_of_change) | Estimate the blast radius of changing a symbol: its direct users plus everything that depends on them, with a risk level. |
| [`init_solution_config`](#init_solution_config) | Collect the raw material for the guided setup of a solution's Layer Profile, Exclude-Namespaces and Test Profile - step 1 of 2; apply_solution_config is the step that writes.

Use it when solution_config_status or the configInit hint of analyze_solution reports an axis as not initialized, or when check_solution_config_drift reports one as stale. |
| [`install_agent_hooks`](#install_agent_hooks) | Install the aicb symbol guard into this project for an agent harness, so a C#-symbol question is REFUSED on a text search and redirected to the tool that answers it. |
| [`instantiation_sites`](#instantiation_sites) | Find where a type is constructed and where it is injected: the narrow 'who creates or obtains an instance of X?' that find_usages (every reference) cannot answer. |
| [`list_insights`](#list_insights) | List code-quality / async / design-smell insights for a session (long methods, fat interfaces, unused types, missing async suffixes, many-parameter methods, ...). |
| [`list_mcp_profiles`](#list_mcp_profiles) | List the MCP profiles in the server's config DB - each with its id, name, the slots that have a template assigned (General appears exactly when a profile-wide template is set), the profile-wide templateId (null = none), whether it carries a skill, its effective tool-set (toolSelection: the class-level CSV, or a 'methods:'-prefixed function-name list when the profile curates individual tool functions; null = lean core), whether it is the active one, AND the render config it applies (tokenBudget / outputFormat / overflowPolicy - a null tokenBudget/overflowPolicy means inherit: the template then the active PipelineProfile decides). |
| [`list_skills`](#list_skills) | The server's capability map: a tools INDEX naming EVERY tool this server has - each exactly once, grouped into three lists by pool state (inPool.core = the tools every profile exposes, in reach-for-them order; inPool.extras = the rest of the active pool, alphabetical; outOfPool = exists but the active tool set does not expose it) - plus the sections that group them by name: the always-on navigation CORE (listed in no menu because it needs none), the task FACETS (id + guidance + template slot + the facet's tool menu), the cross-cutting guidance styles, and the legacy functional skill bundles. |
| [`measure`](#measure) | Report how BIG a read-only query's answer would be - its exact token count - WITHOUT returning the answer. |
| [`pack_for_task`](#pack_for_task) | Goal-driven context packing: given a natural-language task, seed on every symbol the goal names (type or method), expand the neighborhood, and return a token-budgeted AI-Builder-Markdown bundle - with goal-aware trimming that keeps the most task-relevant methods when the budget is tight. |
| [`prepare_task`](#prepare_task) | Build an EDIT-ready context bundle for a task goal: the source of the symbols the goal names, their dependency neighborhood, the test methods that cover them and 1-2 naming/file-convention siblings (the test, the factory, the validator you'd otherwise miss) - as one token-budgeted AI-Builder-MD document.

Prefer this over pack_for_task when you're about to EDIT, not just read. |
| [`refresh_session`](#refresh_session) | Re-analyze the session's solution after YOUR code edits - call it once you have changed .cs files, otherwise find_usages / impact_of_change / list_insights / get_context may keep answering from the STALE pre-edit graph (a silent source of wrong results). |
| [`resolve_injection`](#resolve_injection) | Resolve a Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection registration: the implementation(s) registered for a service, each with its lifetime and registration site.

Use it for 'what do I get when this is injected, and in which host?' - not 'is it used' (find_usages), 'who implements it' (find_implementations) or 'where is it built' (instantiation_sites).

It reads Add{Singleton,Scoped,Transient}, TryAdd* and project-local wrappers ending in a lifetime, plus a foreach over a static table of new(typeof(Service), typeof(Impl)) rows. |
| [`review_context`](#review_context) | Assemble review context for a set of changed symbols in ONE call: per symbol its fan-in, the transitive change impact with a risk level, the types that implement it (if an interface) and the test methods that likely cover it. |
| [`save_session`](#save_session) | Persist the current session's analyzed model as a named Manual snapshot in an aicb DB, so a later session can diff against it with compare_with_previous.

Use it BEFORE a bulk mechanical change (a rename sweep, a signature migration) and call compare_with_previous afterwards. |
| [`server_info`](#server_info) | Report this SERVER's own identity and health: name, version, build commit, the config DB's schema version, and drift warnings about the server binary. |
| [`solution_config_status`](#solution_config_status) | Check whether a solution's Layer Profile, Exclude-Namespaces and Test Profile have been initialized via the guided setup, and which Layer Profile / Exclusion List / Test Profile is currently active. |
| [`solution_metrics`](#solution_metrics) | The solution-wide quality rollup in one call - the numbers the CLI '--fail-on' quality gate evaluates. |
| [`symbol_metrics`](#symbol_metrics) | Report method complexity: McCabe CYCLOMATIC complexity (independent paths) and COGNITIVE complexity (how hard the method is to follow: nesting is penalised, boolean-operator runs collapse), plus the parameter count - for one method by name, or as a ranking of the hotspots. |
| [`symbol_signature`](#symbol_signature) | Return a symbol's signature(s) WITHOUT the body: the type declaration, the method/operator signature or a member's declaration (property, field, event, enum member - the last as its qualified Enum.Member form), plus its XML &lt;summary> doc and its declaring file + start line - for understanding an API without reading the whole file/body, and for navigating straight to it. |
| [`usage_report`](#usage_report) | Report the server-side tool-call telemetry: what the CallTool filter recorded into the config DB's tool_calls table, across every client that used this DB - not this conversation's transcript. |
| [`verify_claim`](#verify_claim) | Verify a structured claim about a change by diffing two analyzed sessions (baseline → changed). |

### analyze_solution

Analyze a C#/.NET solution (.sln, .slnx or .slnf) with Roslyn and cache the result as an in-memory session - the entry point of this server: it returns the session_id the other tools take as sessionId.

Calling it is optional: every tool that takes a sessionId also accepts the absolute solution path and analyzes on first use, so do not call it just to run a query. Call it to read this answer first or to pass layerProfile / dbPath. After editing .cs files call refresh_session, not this: a second analyze_solution is a full reload into a new session.

Returns JSON: sessionId, solutionPath, solutionName, projectCount, fileSetHash, layerProfile, lastAccessUtc, origin, lineNumbersAvailable - plus, only when they apply, analyzePreferredTfmOnly, incompleteRun, configInit (config axes still to set up; see solution_config_status) and agentWiring (the agent's guard hooks are missing here).

When a scanned project could not bind even its core framework types (for example a missing targeting pack), the answer carries incompleteRun - how many, which, and the repair - because every later answer of the session inherits that shortfall. Its absence is no all-clear: an unrestored project that still binds its framework is not flagged here; get_diagnostics names its errors.

It changes no source or project file: it opens the solution through MSBuild (whose design-time build can write generated files under obj/), reads the files as they are on disk (uncommitted edits included) and keeps the model in server memory - by default for 90 minutes after the last use, at most 8 sessions. A large solution can take minutes; with a client progress token it reports progress.

Parameters: normally pass only solutionPath; layer profile, namespace exclusions and test profile then come, per axis, from the server's config DB, else the committed &lt;Solution>.aicb.json beside the solution, else built-in heuristics. layerProfile overrides the layer axis only; dbPath reads all three from another config DB.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `solutionPath` | string | yes | Absolute path to the solution file to analyze (.sln, .slnx or .slnf). |
| `layerProfile` | string \| null |  | Optional absolute path to a layer-mapping profile JSON. Omit to use the config DB's active layer profile (per-solution > app-global) when a config DB is resolved, else the .aicb.json sidecar's profile, else role-based heuristics. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional absolute path to a config/master DB. When given, the DB's CONFIGURED namespace-exclusion list (per-solution row, else app-global default) is applied during analysis, same as the CLI; where the DB configured none, the committed .aicb.json sidecar's list applies, and only without a sidecar the DB's built-in default (a built-in default is not configuration - solution_config_status names the list in force and its source); the DB's active test-detection profile (per-solution > global > default) is resolved for the session so the test-aware tools (find_dead_code / coverage_gaps / symbol_metrics / find_tests_for / find_by_side_effects / assert_absence / prepare_task / list_insights / get_insight / solution_metrics) honor it; AND - unless an explicit layerProfile is given - the DB's active layer-mapping profile (per-solution > app-global) drives the analysis (dependency-graph layers + LAYER_MAP), matching the insights/metrics/CLI-gate path. All three travel with the session, so downstream tools honor them without re-passing dbPath. Omit to use the server's default config DB (the same one the GUI uses), if the server resolved one - so the GUI's per-solution exclusions + test + layer profile apply automatically; else the DB-free default (the built-in exclusion list, default test heuristic, role-based layers). When a config DB is resolved and a config axis (layer/exclusions/test) is not yet initialized via the guided setup, the response carries a configInit hint pointing to solution_config_status. |

### apply_solution_config

Apply a proposed Layer Profile + Exclude-Namespaces + Test Profile configuration for a solution. Creates a new custom layer profile / exclusion list / test profile (tagged with the source solution for provenance), activates them, and marks each touched slot initialized. proposalJson is a JSON object {"layerRules":[{"pattern":".Application.","matchType":"Contains","layer":"Application"}],"exclusions":[{"pattern":"System.","matchType":"StartsWith"}]}; the test axis is given via testProposalJson {"testProjectRules":[{"pattern":".Tests","matchType":"EndsWith"}],"testAttributeNames":["Fact","Theory"]} (rules match PROJECT names) OR via testPreset = xunit|nunit|mstest|default. At least one axis must be non-empty (empty arrays/slots are skipped). matchType is Contains|StartsWith|EndsWith|Exact (an invalid matchType is rejected, not silently defaulted). An exclusion with "keep":true is a keep rule: a namespace it matches is never excluded; exclusions that are all keep rules leave the built-in list in force; the sidecar stores keep rules under "keepNamespaces". Writes to the config/master DB (the given dbPath, or the server's default - the GUI's - if omitted; created if missing) AND to the git-tracked &lt;SolutionName>.aicb.json sidecar next to the .sln (returned as sidecarPath - commit it so the config travels with the repo). An axis this call does not name keeps what the existing sidecar holds for it, and keys it does not know stay as they are. An existing sidecar that cannot be read (malformed, locked) is never rewritten: the call is refused before anything is written, and a file that becomes unreadable while the DB is written is left as it is too (the DB keeps the configuration, a warning says so); a keep rule the file puts inside 'exclusions' is moved to 'keepNamespaces'. A keep flag that is not a JSON boolean is rejected.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Absolute path to the aicb config/master SQLite DB to write the configuration into (created if missing). Omit to use the server's default config DB (the same one the GUI uses), if the server resolved one. |
| `proposalJson` | string \| null |  | Optional layer/exclusion proposal as a JSON object with 'layerRules' and/or 'exclusions' arrays (see tool description). Omit for a test-only apply. |
| `layerProfileName` | string \| null |  | Optional display name for the created layer profile. Omit for an auto-generated name. |
| `exclusionListName` | string \| null |  | Optional display name for the created exclusion list. Omit for an auto-generated name. |
| `layeringPolicy` | string \| null |  | Layer-mapping policy for the new profile: 'Advisory' (default) or 'Strict'. |
| `testProposalJson` | string \| null |  | Optional test-axis proposal as a JSON object {"testProjectRules":[{"pattern":".Tests","matchType":"EndsWith"}],"testAttributeNames":["Fact","Theory"]}. testProjectRules match PROJECT names. Mutually exclusive with testPreset. |
| `testPreset` | string \| null |  | Optional shortcut: clone a built-in test profile (xunit\|nunit\|mstest\|default) into a custom per-solution profile. Mutually exclusive with testProposalJson. |
| `testProfileName` | string \| null |  | Optional display name for the created test profile. Omit for an auto-generated name. |

### architecture_overview

Orient on a whole solution WITHOUT the firewall of full source. When anything was cut, the document LEADS with a &lt;TRUNCATION> block: how many sections were capped, how many entries are shown of how many in total, and one 'SECTION: shown of total' row per capped section - read it before the sections, because the per-section '+N more' lines below state one section's loss each and never the whole. Absent = nothing was cut. Renders a structural-only AI-Builder-Markdown overview: the macro/architecture graphs (layer map, service & class dependency graphs, role graph, entry points + entry-point flow, architecture flow, interface relations) plus a domain summary and a quality-hotspots section (the most complex methods + most-coupled types) - but NO per-type/per-file source-code blocks, so it stays bounded where export_markdown is a 27-29 MB firehose. BOUNDED AT SCALE: each macro section is capped at 80 entries with a '+N more' truncation note, so even a 200+-project monolith returns a usable orientation instead of overflowing the token cap (use export_markdown for the full set, or find_symbol / call_graph / get_context to drill in). PRODUCTION-FOCUSED: test projects are excluded by default (an architecture overview is otherwise dominated by every test method listed as an entry point + its flow trace, which is not part of the production architecture) - set includeTests=true to include *.Tests/*.Spec projects. Method-level call graphs are deliberately omitted (use call_graph / explain_symbol for a specific symbol). Multi-TFM solutions are deduplicated to one logical project per name, keeping the NEWEST TFM's instance (Roslyn loads a &lt;TargetFrameworks> project once per TFM - without the dedup every hotspot/edge appears xN). Recall-safe: works on live AND recalled sessions (on a recalled session quality-hotspot line counts are unavailable, complexity is still shown). Use this FIRST to understand a codebase's shape, then get_context / explain_symbol to drill into a symbol.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `lean` | boolean |  | Lean mode (default TRUE): drop the &lt;AI_CONTEXT_SPEC>/&lt;AI_CONTEXT_META> format-rules preamble and any empty graph sections. Set false for the full AI-Builder-MD document contract. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test projects (default FALSE - production focus: an architecture overview is otherwise flooded by every test method listed as an entry point + its flow trace, bloating the output with scaffolding that is not part of the production architecture). Set true to include *.Tests/*.Spec projects in the graphs. |
| `summaryOnly` | boolean |  | Summary mode (default FALSE): collapse each macro-section to a count + top-N entries instead of up to 80. Use on EXTREME/very-large solutions (200+ projects, heavy generics) where even the bounded overview exceeds the token cap and would otherwise return nothing. |

### assert_absence

Check a NEGATIVE claim against the analyzed model and return confirmed / refuted / indeterminate with evidence. Supported: 'no_tests:&lt;Symbol>' (the symbol has no detected covering test), 'absent:&lt;Symbol>.&lt;axis>' (the semantic axis is verified-absent - developer declared 'none', NOT merely unknown), and 'unknown:&lt;Symbol>.&lt;axis>' (the axis has no provenance entry at all). &lt;Symbol> is a bare name or the qualified Type.Member form - the same strings find_usages / find_tests_for / impact_of_change resolve, so the pre-edit gate's tools accept one vocabulary; a name that resolves to nothing declared says so ('resolves to no declared type or member'), which is a statement about the name, not a claim the code lacks it. axis is e.g. role/layer/domain/context/responsibility; an axis name not recorded anywhere in the solution returns 'indeterminate' with the actual recorded axes as evidence (a typo'd/invented axis is NOT silently 'confirmed'). Conservative in BOTH directions: a claim the model cannot prove is 'indeterminate', never falsely confirmed - and 'refuted' for a no_tests claim requires at least one STRONG covering test, as find_tests_for defines its tiers; the reason states the split between the strong tiers and the name-only matches, matching find_tests_for's invokesTotal. Tests that merely carry the symbol in their NAME yield 'indeterminate' with that split disclosed, not a refutation - a test named after a symbol is not proof it exercises it. Use to validate 'this service is untested' or 'role is explicitly unset' before relying on it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `claim` | string | yes | The negative claim: 'no_tests:&lt;Symbol>', 'absent:&lt;Symbol>.&lt;axis>', or 'unknown:&lt;Symbol>.&lt;axis>'. |

### batch

Run several read-only query tools in ONE round-trip against one shared session. measure is the sibling that reports what each answer would cost instead of returning it.

Use it whenever two or more questions do not depend on each other's answers; a solution path as sessionId is analyzed once.

queries is an array of {tool, args}: args is that tool's own arguments as a JSON object WITHOUT sessionId (omit it for a tool that takes none). Example: queries=[{"tool":"find_usages","args":{"symbol":"Foo"}},{"tool":"find_tests_for","args":{"symbol":"Foo"}}]. At most 16 per call: more fails the whole call, as does a sessionId that does not resolve.

Returns { results: [{tool, ok, result | error}], count, okCount }, in query order. A failing sub-query answers ok:false + error and the rest still return. A JSON tool's result is nested as an object, a Markdown tool's is the string. The answers share a response budget of about 9000 tokens: one that no longer fits is omitted with ok:false and a pointer to call that tool directly - after its work was done. 'note' on an item names arguments the tool does not have; they are ignored, not rejected.

Dispatchable is a fixed registry of read-only queries about the analyzed code, among them find_*/get_*/impact_of_change/symbol_signature/explain_symbol/calls_external/resolve_injection/symbol_metrics/list_insights. Refused per item, with the registry's names listed - call these directly where the profile exposes them: tools that mutate session state or write (such as analyze_solution/refresh_session/apply_solution_config/save_session/remember_codebase/export_markdown/install_agent_hooks), poor batch members (evaluate_change_set/init_solution_config/prepare_task/review_context), tools needing a second session or snapshot (semantic_diff/diff_review/verify_claim/compare_with_previous) and the session, configuration and server tools. A tool the active MCP profile does not expose is refused per item too, as a direct call would be - also when a refusal's list names it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. Shared by ALL sub-queries - do NOT repeat it inside each query's args. |
| `queries` | array | yes | The read-only sub-queries: an array of { tool, args } objects. 'tool' is a read-only tool name; 'args' is that tool's argument object (without sessionId), omittable when the tool needs no arguments. Max 16. |

### call_graph

Build a depth-limited call graph rooted at a method NAME. direction='callees' follows project-internal calls outward; direction='callers' follows the inverse (who calls this). Returns (caller, callee) edges using method-lookup keys, cycle-safe and capped at 500 edges (truncated flag). Rooted at the name, NOT at one symbol: EVERY same-named declaration in the solution is a root and the graph is their union, so a common name (e.g. 'ExecuteAsync') can pull in unrelated members and inflate the payload. 'rootedAt' lists the declarations actually walked - check it when the result looks too big (then re-query a rarer name) and when it is empty (the name resolved to nothing, which an empty edge list alone does not tell you).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `method` | string | yes | The root method's name. |
| `depth` | integer |  | Max traversal depth (1-10). Default 2. |
| `direction` | string |  | 'callees' (default) or 'callers'. |

### calls_external

Find the code that calls an EXTERNAL member - BCL or package - whose key contains a pattern. find_usages answers for solution symbols only; find_by_side_effects classifies the same calls into effect tokens.

Use it for 'who calls the risky or external API X?': AOT and trimming readiness, security surface, dependency footprint (pattern 'Process.Start', 'Assembly.Load', 'DateTime.UtcNow').

Returns scope, pattern, methodsScanned, matches - a capped envelope of at most 200 hits, sorted by type and name, not ranked - and testMatchesFiltered when the test filter removed hits. A hit carries name, declaringType, namespace, matchedCalls (invoked methods and method groups, keys like 'System.IO.File.ReadAllText(string)') and matchedReads (external properties read or written, like 'System.DateTime.UtcNow'). The units scanned are methods plus every accessor and constructor with a body, under their metadata names (get_X, set_X, .ctor); an initializer counts toward the constructor that runs it.

The pattern is a case-insensitive substring of the whole key, parameter list included, so a type name also hits the units that only pass that type to another API. It is an open vocabulary: there is no did-you-mean, and empty is now a strong statement, though not absolute. Not recorded: an external field read ('string.Empty'), a bare 'new X()', operators and conversions, indexers, event subscriptions and compiler-lowered calls (using, foreach, await). Cross-check a surprising empty against the declaring type ('DateTime' instead of 'DateTime.UtcNow'). A 'note' leads the answer when it is empty - it says when only the test filter emptied it - and when a project's core references did not resolve: an unresolved call records no key.

Read-only; works on a recalled session. Test-project code is excluded by default; includeTests=true includes it. testMatchesFiltered counts the filtered-out units, which methodsScanned does not include. scope is 'solution' or a namespace prefix, matched case-insensitively on segment boundaries.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `pattern` | string | yes | A substring of the external (BCL/third-party) call key to match (case-insensitive), e.g. 'Process.Start', 'File.', 'Assembly.Load', 'System.Reflection', 'JsonSerializer'. Required - a very broad pattern (e.g. 'System') truncates at 200. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix (e.g. 'MyApp.Infrastructure') to narrow scope. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test-project methods (default false - production focus; test setup/assertions calling external APIs would otherwise drown the signal). |

### check_solution_config_drift

Check whether a solution's active Layer Profile, Exclude-Namespaces and Test Profile still FIT the code. solution_config_status tells you WHICH configuration is active and where it comes from.

Use it on a solution configured a while ago, or when layer or exclusion results look off; a stale axis is rebuilt with init_solution_config and apply_solution_config. Do not use it on a never-configured solution: nothing is evaluated there.

Three conservative signals: layer - declared (own) namespaces that no rule of the active layer profile maps; exclusion - EXTERNAL referenced namespaces that the active exclusion list does not cover; test - projects the default heuristic classifies as test projects that the active custom test profile's rules do not match.

Returns JSON with layer, exclusion and test, each carrying source (db / sidecar / built-in / none), name, status, stale, considered (the denominator), sample (the drifted names as items/count/totalFound/truncated, max 50) and reason, which states the drifted count against considered. status is 'stale' from 3 drifted names on for layer and exclusion, and for test when more than a quarter of the considered projects drifted; else 'ok', and an 'ok' with a sample is still worth reading. 'built-in-preset' and 'not-configured' mean the axis was NOT evaluated: only a custom config is judged (a generic preset is a choice, not drift). sidecarProblem appears when the .aicb.json could not be read.

It changes no configuration and creates no solution row; a dbPath that does not exist is refused with an error, an older DB is migrated. It judges the configuration a plain analyze_solution resolves NOW, not a layerProfile the session was analyzed with. It needs a live session, not a recalled one.

Parameters: normally pass only sessionId (an absolute .sln path works too). Pass dbPath only if the session was analyzed with that same dbPath; otherwise this judges a configuration the analysis did not use.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional absolute path to the aicb config/master DB. If given, the config the DB holds for the solution (per-solution row, then app-global default) takes precedence over the .aicb.json sidecar; a built-in default in the DB does not. Omit to fall back to the server's default config DB (the GUI's, if resolved), else only the .aicb.json sidecar next to the .sln. |

### compare_with_previous

Diff the current session against a previously saved snapshot of the SAME solution - the newest by default, or the N-th previous via snapshotsBack (0=newest saved, 1=the one before, ...). Optionally narrow the diff to a single type and/or method. Returns added/removed types plus, per changed type, added/removed methods and signature changes. Requires a sessionId and at least one earlier save_session; dbPath is optional and defaults to the server's standard config DB when omitted. Name-based, syntactic (no method-body diff).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The current session_id (the 'after' side of the diff). Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional absolute path to the aicb SQLite DB holding the saved snapshots. Omit to use the server's standard config DB. |
| `snapshotsBack` | integer |  | 0 = newest saved snapshot, 1 = the one before it, etc. (index into the per-solution history, newest first). |
| `typeName` | string \| null |  | Optional: restrict the diff to this type (simple name, case-insensitive). Omit for the whole-solution diff. A simple name ALSO matches the namespace-qualified form the diff renders for a type whose simple name collides in the solution - then the answer spans every type of that name and 'note' says which; pass one of those qualified names to narrow to a single type. Not a substring match: 'MyApi' never matches 'MyApiExtensions'. When a filter EMPTIES a diff that did have changes, 'note' says so and names the axis that missed, because 'isIdentical: true' then describes the filtered view and not the solution. On a diff that was ALREADY empty there is no note and none is owed: 'your filter matched nothing' and 'nothing changed' are the same state there, so a typo'd name and a real one answer identically - check the spelling with find_symbol rather than reading that agreement as confirmation. |
| `methodName` | string \| null |  | Optional: within that type, restrict to this method name (case-insensitive). Omit for all methods of the type. Same disclosure rule as typeName: if the type matched and this name matches none of its added/removed/signature-changed methods, the type is dropped from the answer and 'note' says which of the two filters came up empty - an empty view here is never evidence that the method is unchanged. |

### coverage_gaps

List what is NOT covered in a scope: 'uncovered' - production methods no test code calls directly - and 'verifiedAbsent' - semantic axes a developer explicitly declared as 'none'. find_tests_for asks the opposite question for one symbol.

Use it to find untested code before claiming coverage. THE LIST IS ONE HOP, NOT A COVERAGE MEASUREMENT: a method a test reaches THROUGH another method (a CLI verb behind its command builder, a handler behind a dispatcher) is listed although it is exercised - on this server's own solution that is most of the list. So read each entry's testReachDepth: the hops to the nearest directly called method (1 = one of those calls it), ABSENT when no test reaches the method at all. Those are the real gaps. The walk follows interface and abstract dispatch; an entry reached only that way carries viaDispatch.

Returns scope, a 'note' when uncovered is non-empty, symbolsScanned, uncovered and verifiedAbsent (at most 200 items each), transitivelyReached, judgedUnits, testProjectsExcluded, testFixtureTypesExcluded and reachedOnlyThroughDispatch. uncovered is sorted by type and name, not by depth, so on a large scope the cap cuts alphabetically: narrow the scope to see the rest.

What counts: test code is every method of a test project, every test-attributed method and every method of a type that declares one. Only ordinary methods are units: a call from a constructor or accessor is not read. Abstract and interface declarations are excluded, and a weak test-name match does not count.

THE POPULATION IS DISCLOSED: judgedUnits is the methods the uncovered list is drawn from, out of symbolsScanned; testProjectsExcluded and testFixtureTypesExcluded count what was set aside as test code. A gap count without its denominator is meaningless. symbolsScanned 0 means the scope matched no namespace.

Read-only. scope is 'solution' or a namespace prefix, case-insensitive, matched on segment boundaries. There is no test switch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix to narrow which symbols are checked. |

### describe_api_surface

List the PUBLIC API SURFACE of a solution or namespace - every externally-visible type with its externally-visible members (constructors, properties, fields, methods, user-defined operators), each as a compact declaration signature. The "header"/contract view: what a consumer of this assembly can actually reference, WITHOUT the source bodies (like a public-API digest, not a firehose). A type is included when its OWN declared accessibility is externally visible - public or the protected family (reachable by a subclass in another assembly); its members likewise. A property renders only the accessors that are themselves visible (a { get; private set; } shows as { get; }), a const carries its value, an enum is listed as a type (its values are not in the model). includeInternal=true additionally surfaces the internal family. PRODUCTION-FOCUSED: test projects are excluded by default (a shipped API surface is production code) - set includeTests=true to include *.Tests/*.Spec projects. scope='solution' (default) covers everything; a namespace prefix narrows it. The type list is capped (the true total travels in the envelope; narrow by namespace or filter to see the rest); members per type are whole. Recall-safe (reads persisted accessibility + signature facts) → works on live AND recalled sessions. Known v1 simplifications: accessibility is the type's OWN declared modifier (effective accessibility through the nesting chain is not computed - a public member of a type nested in an internal type is still listed); a type declared with NO access modifier is stored as private by the analyzer, so a modifier-omitted (compiler-internal) top-level type is not surfaced even with includeInternal. Use it to review a public contract before changing it, or as the baseline for a contract comparison - save_session then compare_with_previous, or diff_public_contract, which is outside the default profile's pool.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default - the whole solution) or a namespace prefix (e.g. 'MyApp.Contracts') to narrow the surface. |
| `includeInternal` | boolean |  | Include the internal family (internal / private-protected) types + members too (default FALSE = only the externally-visible public/protected surface). |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test projects (default FALSE - a shipped API surface is production code). Set true to include *.Tests/*.Spec projects. |

### detect_circular_dependencies

Detect circular NAMESPACE dependencies: groups of namespaces that depend on each other in a cycle - a modularity smell the compiler allows, unlike project-reference cycles. The layer-violation insight in list_insights checks the direction rule; this answers the orthogonal 'who is mutually entangled?'.

Use it before splitting an assembly or moving types between namespaces.

Returns scope, namespacesScanned, cyclesFound and cycles, at most 100. Each cycle is a strongly connected component of two or more namespaces and carries namespaces, size, projects, spansMultipleProjects, edgeCount, edgesTruncated and edges: one 'witness' type -> type reference per directed namespace pair (fromNamespace, toNamespace, fromType, toType, typeEdgeCount). Read the witnesses as EXAMPLES, not as a work list: edgeCount counts directed namespace pairs, and typeEdgeCount says how many distinct type references cross that one boundary. Where it is above 1, removing the shown reference leaves the edge standing. Cycles that span assemblies come first, then the largest. Witness edges are capped per cycle, and edgesTruncated says when; the namespace list is complete. A cycle inside one assembly is namespace organisation; one that spans assemblies means a namespace is reused across DLL boundaries.

Edges come from the type references a type's facts record by full name - member, field, parameter, return and typeof types, base class and interfaces among them - so a same-named type in two namespaces is never conflated, and external references are ignored.

cyclesFound 0 under scope 'solution' means no cycle among the scanned namespaces. Under a prefix it only means no cycle touches a namespace starting with that text, and an unknown prefix answers the same zero.

Read-only; works on a recalled session. Test projects are excluded by default (includeTests=true includes them). scope is 'solution' or a plain case-insensitive namespace prefix: it narrows the report, not the graph, and returns a whole cycle when one of its namespaces matches.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default - all cycles) or a namespace prefix to report only cycles whose members include that prefix. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test projects (default FALSE - production focus: a test->production reference is one-way and not an architecture cycle). Set true to include them. |

### docs

The aicb operating manual - how to USE this server, as opposed to what it can tell you about your code. Call it with no arguments for the directory (each page with a one-line summary and a token estimate, so you can budget); pass one or more page ids to read them, or the route id 'init' for the whole first run in order. Pages: 'overview' (what aicb is and is not, the three ways to run it), 'install' (getting the dotnet tool, `aicb init`, and what it writes - the client's .mcp.json entry and the agent skill a tool install cannot deliver; for setting aicb up somewhere else, or finishing a half-done setup), 'first-context' (from a .sln to your first context - and why the full export is rarely the right call), 'navigation' (which tool answers which question about the code, the blast-radius call before editing shared code, and where plain text search is still right), 'solution-config' (layers / exclusions / test detection and the .aicb.json sidecar), 'glossary' (session, facet, MCP profile, snapshot, insight, AI-Builder MD). Start here if you have not used aicb before. No session and no solution needed.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `topics` | array \| null |  | Optional page or route ids. Omit for the directory. A route id ('init') expands to its pages in reading order; repeats collapse, so asking for a route and one of its pages yields one copy. Unknown ids are named back to you rather than silently dropped. |

### evaluate_change_set

Advisory policy gate: which code-quality / design-smell / layer-violation findings would this edit INTRODUCE? Ask BEFORE writing it. Cheapest form - the edit you are about to make anyway: changes: [{filePath, oldText, newText}], the snippet being replaced and what it becomes (the shape an editor takes). The full file is rebuilt here from the analyzed document, so the payload is the size of the CHANGE, not of the file, and 'operation' defaults to 'modify'. oldText must occur EXACTLY ONCE - a missing or ambiguous anchor is an error, never a silently different edit; line endings are reconciled for you; an empty newText deletes the snippet. Full-text form still works and is required for add/delete: {filePath, operation: 'modify'|'add'|'delete', newContent}. Findings are a delta against the current session, so pre-existing debt is never blamed. The changeset is applied as an in-memory Roslyn overlay (NO disk write, the session is untouched) and the amended solution is re-analyzed. Verdict: pass / warn / block. Policy: 'block_on_critical' (default) | 'block_on_warning' | 'advisory' (an unknown policy is rejected, not silently treated as advisory). Advisory only - an MCP tool cannot block; the real blocking gate is the CLI '--fail-on'. The findings delta honors the session's explicit layer profile (analyze_solution(layerProfile) / sidecar) and its resolved test-detection profile on both sides; pass dbPath to also use that DB's active QualityProfile (producer thresholds + toggles) and its configured default layer profile (per-solution > app-global; the explicit session profile still wins) - same semantics as list_insights, so the gate judges by the same configured thresholds as the CLI gate. apply_change_set is out of scope. Pass absolute file paths matching the analyzed documents.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution (the baseline). Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `changes` | array | yes | The proposed file changes. Per change: filePath (absolute), plus EITHER the anchor patch oldText + newText (preferred - 'operation' may be omitted, it defaults to 'modify') OR the full new file text newContent with operation 'modify'/'add' ('delete' takes neither). |
| `policy` | string \| null |  | Policy: 'block_on_critical' (default) \| 'block_on_warning' \| 'advisory'. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional path to an AIContextBuilder SQLite DB. When set, producer thresholds + toggles come from that DB's active QualityProfile AND its configured default layer profile (per-solution > app-global) drives the layer-violation analysis on BOTH delta sides (an explicit analyze_solution(layerProfile) wins); omit to fall back to the server's default config DB (the GUI's, if the server resolved one), else the default profile + session axes, and the layer profile to the config DB the session was analysed against - the one its renders read. |

### explain_symbol

Explain a symbol: its source PLUS a chosen environment, as ONE dense AI-Builder-Markdown slice - the cold-read in a single call instead of 4-6 (get_context + find_usages + find_implementations + find_tests_for + ...). 'include' selects the environment axes (any combination): callers (the members that reference it, with their bodies, and their owner types as structure - not the calling types whole), callees (what it calls/depends on, depth 1), implementations (the types implementing it, if it's an interface), tests (its covering test cases), siblings (naming/file-convention kin), quality (complexity / efferent-coupling hotspot metrics). A partial type renders as ONE block (its declaration fragments are folded, a leading comment says which files) instead of one identical block per file. An empty include returns just the symbol's source - and then the manifest names the axes you could have asked for, so that answer is a stated choice rather than a silent default; an include token that names no axis is reported as dropped, whether or not a sibling token was valid. A leading manifest comment discloses what each merge axis actually found - so '(none)' is an honest negative (no impl / no caller / no test), not 'not asked'. Pass a type or method simple name (use find_symbol to disambiguate). Recall-safe (reads persisted facts); prefer it over export_markdown for one symbol's world. Multi-TFM solutions are deduplicated to one logical project per name (NEWEST TFM's instance, matching find_symbol's view).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbol` | string | yes | The type or method simple name to center on (use find_symbol to disambiguate), or the qualified Type.Member form to focus ONE declaration of a shared method name - the same string find_usages / find_tests_for / impact_of_change resolve. A bare name that matches several declarations seeds them all (a whole family can then be budget-capped), and the manifest says so and names the qualified form. |
| `include` | array \| null |  | Which environment axes to include (any combination, case-insensitive): callers, callees, implementations, tests, siblings, quality. Empty/omitted = just the symbol's source. |
| `budget` | integer \| null |  | Optional token budget (floored at 8000). Compacts/drops method bodies and, when the neighborhood overflows, drops the least-relevant types. The center symbol is always kept - with its full source when that fits, otherwise as STRUCTURE (identity, members, every method signature) plus a leading note that names the measured size of the full-code render and the budget that would hold it, so a 2000-line type under budget:8000 costs ~2000 tokens, not ~24000. The bundled environment (callers / tests / siblings / implementations) is BUDGET-BOUND - under a tight budget it is dropped to fit (a leading comment names the drops so you can ask for one by name). Omitted, the slice still renders against a ceiling (the active MCP profile's token budget, else a ~10000-token default budget) that bounds the merged environment - relevant above all with include=["callees"], whose outward neighborhood is the widest slice this server produces. |
| `lean` | boolean |  | Lean slice (default TRUE): drop the &lt;AI_CONTEXT_SPEC>/&lt;AI_CONTEXT_META> format-rules preamble and omit enabled-but-empty graph sections. Set false for the full AI-Builder-MD document with the format contract. |

### export_markdown

Render the cached analysis of a session as AI-Builder Markdown. No re-analysis - instant. NOTE: this renders the WHOLE solution - on a large codebase that is many megabytes, and an answer over the server's message ceiling (16,000,000 bytes as JSON unless AICB_MCP_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES says otherwise) is not sent: the call is refused with its size, because MCP clients drop larger messages. Pass outputPath for anything but a small solution. For a bounded view prefer architecture_overview (whole-solution orientation, structural-only, no per-type source) or get_context / explain_symbol (one symbol's world). When the server has a config DB (the default: a plain 'aicb mcp' resolves the standard one), the active MCP profile drives the render: the chosen facet's template (detail presets, graphs, line numbers, quality metrics) is used; otherwise the full default render is used. Returns the Markdown; if outputPath is given it writes the file and returns a short confirmation (not the full content), so a large render does not flood the response.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `facet` | string \| null |  | Optional facet to render through - the task axis of this call: General (default), Exploration, Refactoring, Debugging, Review, Testing, Documentation, Architecture, or Performance. The facet picks the active MCP profile's matching template and appends a short work-style trailer with suggested next tools. Unknown/empty falls back to General; a facet whose slot has no template assigned falls back to the active context template. (The former name 'slot' is still accepted.) |
| `outputPath` | string \| null |  | Optional absolute path to write the Markdown to (UTF-8, no BOM). When given, the tool writes the file and returns a short confirmation (path + size) instead of the full markdown - so a large (whole-solution) render does not flood the response. |
| `format` | string \| null |  | Optional inner notation of the rendered Markdown: 'tag' (the established AI-Builder tag format) or 'yaml' (idiomatic YAML - a lossless re-notation, not a different selection of content). Pick whichever notation you parse more reliably. When given, this explicit value wins; when omitted, the active MCP profile's OutputFormat is used (profile-aware path), else yaml (the DB-free default). The .md branding is unchanged. Any other value counts as omitted: the profile's format (else yaml) applies, and the response starts with a note naming the ignored value. |

### find_binding_usages

List the {Binding ...} sites in the solution's .xaml and .axaml markup that name a member path, with what each one resolves against. find_usages carries a markup edge for a root member bound against the DataContext; this tool lists every site, redirected bindings included. find_unresolved_bindings checks whether a bound member exists on its view-model.

Use it before renaming or deleting a view-model member.

With a path: sites (view, line, path, form), siteCount, byForm, deeperSegmentSites + deeperSegmentSiteCount, pathlessBindingCount, scannedFileCount, sitesTruncated and a note. form is dataContext (no redirect), elementName, relativeSource or source. A path matches as the whole path or as its ROOT segment: 'Foo' finds {Binding Foo} and {Binding Foo.Bar}. The 'Bar' of {Binding Foo.Bar} is a member of Foo's type and is reported apart in deeperSegmentSites. On an elementName or relativeSource binding a leading 'DataContext.' is the hop to the element's view-model: {Binding DataContext.Cmd, RelativeSource=...} is a site of 'Cmd'.

Without a path: the inventory - members (member, siteCount, byForm), most-bound first, with distinctMemberCount and totalSiteCount. Lists are capped at 200; the counts are true totals. pathlessBindingCount is every binding without a plain member root (an empty {Binding}, {Binding Mode=OneWay}, an attached-property path); it counts the whole solution, whatever scope and form say.

The markup is read from disk at every call, so a markup edit needs no refresh_session. Only the {Binding} markup extension is read ({CompiledBinding} too in .axaml): a binding built in code-behind, element-syntax &lt;Binding Path="..."/>, {x:Bind}, {TemplateBinding} and a path assembled at runtime are invisible here - zero sites means 'verify before renaming or deleting', not proof.

Read-only; test projects are scanned too. path is a case-sensitive markup path and is not resolved as a symbol. An unknown form matches nothing, and the note says so. scope is 'solution' or a substring of the view path.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `path` | string \| null |  | The exact (case-sensitive) bound member path, e.g. 'GestureLabel' or 'Foo.Bar'. Omit for the inventory view (every bound root member with its site counts). |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a view-path substring (e.g. 'AIContextBuilder.UI/Views/Dialogs') to narrow which markup files are reported. |
| `form` | string \| null |  | Optional form filter: 'dataContext', 'elementName', 'relativeSource' or 'source'. Omit for all forms. Applies to both views. |

### find_by_attribute

Find symbols (types, methods, properties or fields) that carry a given ATTRIBUTE - a cross-cutting query that find_symbol (name-only) cannot do. The attribute name is matched format-independently: the last name segment, with an optional 'Attribute' suffix stripped, case-insensitive. So 'Obsolete', 'ObsoleteAttribute' and 'System.ObsoleteAttribute' all match the same symbols (types store the fully-qualified attribute class, methods/properties/fields store the source-syntax name - this reconciles both). The raw stored attribute list travels with each hit so you see the ground truth. kinds = 'all' (default - types + methods + properties + fields) / 'type' / 'method' / 'property' / 'field'. Member scanning surfaces a member-level attribute like a CommunityToolkit '[ObservableProperty]' (on a backing field or a modern partial property) or a '[JsonProperty]' that a type/method-only scan misses. Use it for '[Obsolete]', '[ApiController]', '[Authorize]', test attributes, etc. The 'method' axis includes constructors and accessors with a body (named .ctor / get_X / set_X), so a [JsonConstructor] or an [Obsolete] setter is found. Deterministic from Roslyn - works on recalled sessions. Capped at 200.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `attribute` | string | yes | The attribute to find (e.g. 'Obsolete', 'ApiController', 'Fact'). Suffix/namespace are normalized away - required. |
| `kinds` | string |  | Which symbol kinds to search: 'all' (default - types + methods + properties + fields), 'type', 'method', 'property', or 'field'. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix (e.g. 'MyApp.Api') to narrow scope. |

### find_by_event_subscription

Find the TYPES that subscribe to a C# event: a '+=' whose left side resolves to an event, anywhere in the type (constructor, method, accessor, lambda). find_usages on an event the solution declares lists the subscribing, unsubscribing and raising METHODS; this tool works at type level and also sees external events ('Button.Click').

Use it for 'who listens to this event?' and to find where handlers are wired. Only subscriptions ('+=') are read, not '-='; a '+=' on a number, a string or a delegate field is not a subscription and is skipped.

Returns scope, event, typesScanned, subscriptionSitesChecked, subscriptionSitesUnresolved, matches - a capped envelope of at most 200 types (name, namespace, events), sorted by namespace and name - and when they apply 'note', availableEvents and testMatchesFiltered. A hit lists ALL event keys the type subscribes to ('DeclaringType.EventName'), not only the one filtered on.

Reading an empty answer: on zero matches availableEvents lists the events subscribed in scope. When testMatchesFiltered is present, read it first - the name was right and only its subscribers were tests. An EMPTY availableEvents means no subscription was RECORDED, which is not the same as none being present: recognition needs a resolved left side, so in a project whose types do not resolve every subscription is missing. The two site counts settle it: subscriptionSitesChecked is every '+=' the rule was applied to, subscriptionSitesUnresolved those whose left side could not be resolved. '0 of 0' is nothing to see, '0 of 7, 0 unresolved' a real absence, '0 of 7, 7 unresolved' an unmeasured scope - and that one carries a note.

Read-only; works on a recalled session. eventName is matched exactly, never as a substring; omit it to list every subscribing type. Test-project types are excluded by default (includeTests=true includes them).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `eventName` | string \| null |  | Filter to types subscribing to this event - the event name ('Click') or the qualified 'DeclaringType.EventName' key ('Button.Click'), case-insensitive. Omit to list every type with any subscription. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix (e.g. 'MyApp.UI') to narrow scope. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test-project types (default false - production focus; test setup that wires events would drown the signal). |

### find_by_semantics

Find types and methods by their resolved semantics: layer, role, domain, responsibility. Filters combine with AND, and each hit names where a matched value came from.

Use it for 'list the services of the Infrastructure layer' or 'which types carry role X?'. At least one filter is required.

layer and role match the WHOLE value, case-insensitively: role='View' is one view, not every ViewModel. Values that merely contain the query are counted in nearMisses (axis, value, symbols) and named in a leading 'note', never listed as matches. domain and responsibility are free text and match as a case-insensitive substring; responsibility exists on types only, so setting it matches no method. The echoed criteria show the mode ('role=View' vs 'domain~order').

Returns criteria, a 'note' when there are near misses, minConfidence, matches - at most 200 items (kind, name, declaringType, namespace, matched), types first - and when they apply availableAxisValues and nearMisses. matched lists per filtered axis the field, the value and its source: 'fact', 'ai', 'inferred' or 'none'.

The layer and role values the built-in inference assigns are listed on those parameters; there is no 'Repository' role and an enum gets none. A layer profile or an &lt;ai> annotation adds values in its own spelling ('viewmodel-item' beside 'ViewModel'). Nothing infers a domain: that axis matches only where an &lt;ai> annotation set one.

On zero matches availableAxisValues lists, for the queried axes, the values present under the same minConfidence (up to 50 per axis; the key is absent when there are none). A queried value missing from it is unknown at that confidence; if it is listed, the AND of your filters was empty.

Read-only; test-project symbols are matched like production ones.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `layer` | string \| null |  | Match symbols whose resolved Layer EQUALS this (whole value, case-insensitive). The built-in inference assigns Domain / Application / Infrastructure / Presentation / Contracts; a layer profile adds its own names. Omit to not filter on layer. |
| `role` | string \| null |  | Match symbols whose resolved Role EQUALS this (whole value, case-insensitive). Inferred TYPE roles: Service, Helper, Model, Record, Interface, Builder, ViewModel, Converter, Controller, Middleware, Attribute, Exception, EntryPoint, ContractModel, Type - there is NO 'Repository' (a repository class is mostly 'Service'), and an enum gets no role. Methods use a category role (e.g. Query, Command, Mapping, Validation, Orchestration). &lt;ai>-asserted roles add values of their own. Omit to not filter on role. |
| `domain` | string \| null |  | Match symbols whose resolved Domain contains this (free text, set by an &lt;ai> annotation - nothing infers it). Omit to not filter on domain. |
| `responsibility` | string \| null |  | Match TYPES whose resolved Responsibility contains this (types only; free text). Omit to not filter. |
| `minConfidence` | string |  | Confidence floor: 'any' (default - include inferred guesses) or 'asserted' (only fact/ai). Any other value is rejected (not silently treated as 'any'). |

### find_by_side_effects

Find code by its side-effect profile: what a method touches in the outside world. Each unit carries effect tokens from a closed set - io, network, database, serialization, logging, cache, messaging, unknown ('unknown' = an external call the analysis could not classify) - or none, which makes it pure. calls_external lists the external calls and property accesses behind a token; an effect that comes from a 'new X()' or is inherited from a callee has no row there.

Use it for 'what hits the database or the network?' and to find pure methods. Effects are propagated along project calls: a method that calls a method that writes a file counts as 'io'.

With neither effect nor purity, only impure units are listed. An effect or a purity outside its vocabulary is rejected with the valid values, never answered with a silent zero; effect together with purity='pure' is rejected too.

Returns scope, effect, purity, methodsScanned, matches - a capped envelope of at most 200 hits (name, declaringType, namespace, effects), sorted by type and name - and when they apply 'note', availableEffects and testMatchesFiltered. The units are methods plus every accessor and constructor with a body, under their metadata names (get_X, set_X, .ctor, .cctor); the purity='pure' listing is methods-only. A hit does not say which of its effects are direct and which inherited.

On zero matches availableEffects lists the tokens present in scope, so an empty result reads 'valid token, nothing in scope records it'; the note quotes what the token means ('cache' = calls into an external cache API, not a cache held in memory). availableEffects is omitted when methodsScanned is 0: nothing was scanned. A 'note' leads the answer when a project's core references did not resolve: an unresolved run reports methods as PURE that are not.

Read-only; works on a recalled session. Test-project code is excluded by default (includeTests=true includes it); testMatchesFiltered counts what the filter removed, units methodsScanned does not include.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `effect` | string \| null |  | Filter to methods carrying this effect token - exactly one of: io, network, database, serialization, logging, cache, messaging, unknown (case-insensitive; any other value is rejected, not answered with zero). Omit to not filter on a specific effect. |
| `purity` | string |  | 'any' (default), 'pure' (only side-effect-free methods), or 'impure' (only methods with at least one effect). |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix (e.g. 'MyApp.Infrastructure') to narrow scope. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test-project methods (default false - production focus: a 'what hits the DB?' query is otherwise drowned by Seed*/Migrate_*/*RepositoryTests). Set true to also list the methods of test projects. |

### find_dead_code

List dead-code suspects on two axes. kinds='type': types with no incoming reference in the reverse type fan-in, the source find_usages reads. kinds='method' (the default): PRIVATE methods whose recorded caller list is empty. kinds='all': both.

The default axis skips a private method whose caller is code the analysis does not walk ([RelayCommand] or other framework attributes, partial methods, markup or designer event handlers, static Main, record PrintMembers, ShouldSerialize/Reset) or whose callers were not measured (unresolved references, explicit interface implementations). A nameof in a method's attribute (CanExecute) is a call.

Returns scope, a 'note' first when there is one, methodsScanned, deadMethods and - when the type axis ran - typesScanned and deadTypes: at most 200 items each (methods: name, declaringType, namespace; types: name, kind, accessibility, namespace). Counters, each omitted at zero: what was not judged - methodsIneligible (split into methodsIneligibleNotPrivate, methodsIneligibleFrameworkInvoked and methodsIneligibleUnanalyzedCallers), typesIneligible (split into typesIneligibleStructural, typesIneligibleTestScaffolding, typesIneligibleFrameworkActivated, typesIneligibleMarkupReferenced), typesUnexamined (types the type axis would have judged when only the method axis ran) - and the candidates the test filter removed, testMethodsFiltered and testTypesFiltered.

A listed candidate is a suspect, not a verdict: the note names what a zero fan-in does not prove and how to confirm one before deleting it. The type axis exempts what it cannot see being used: interfaces, static classes, types named *Extensions, test scaffolding, framework- or reflection-activated types and markup-referenced types. An empty answer without a note means at least one axis judged an eligible population and found nothing; for the method axis read methodsIneligible against methodsScanned.

Read-only; works on a recalled session. Test projects are excluded by default. Any other non-blank kinds value runs both axes.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix (e.g. 'MyApp.Core') to narrow scope. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test-project methods/types (default false - production dead-code; a private test-helper without callers is not production dead code). |
| `kinds` | string |  | 'method' (default): private methods with a measured, empty caller list - see the description for what that axis does not judge; 'type': types with no incoming reference; 'all': both. |

### find_implementations

List the types that implement an interface, whether the interface is declared in the solution or external (IDisposable, IEquatable). The interface counterpart to get_type_hierarchy (class inheritance) and find_overrides (methods).

Use it before changing an interface member, to find every type that has to follow, and to tell real implementers from test doubles.

Returns items [{name, isAbstract, kind, isTestProject, namespace, declaration, via}], count, totalFound, truncated - at most 100 items, sorted by name. kind is class, struct, record or interface; isAbstract marks an abstract base ('FooBase : IFoo'); 'declaration' is the arity-qualified form of a generic implementer ('PolicyWrap&lt;TResult>'); via:'back-edge' marks an item known only from the interface's own implementer list, not from an interface the type declares.

Test-project implementers are excluded by default; when that filter removed something the answer carries testImplementationsFiltered: N (absent = nothing was hidden), so a short list is never silently short.

An empty answer carries a 'hint' in two cases: the name is a type that is not an interface (use get_type_hierarchy or find_overrides), or no indexed type carries the name (with a did-you-mean when one is close; a delegate type counts as undeclared). The second also fires for an external interface whose implementers were all filtered as tests - testImplementationsFiltered beside it says so. An interface nobody implements answers a bare empty list. When a project's core references did not resolve, a leading 'note' marks the inventory as partial until restore or build, then refresh_session.

Read-only. interfaceName is the simple name, case-sensitive: a namespace-qualified name matches nothing. Two interfaces that share a simple name answer as one list.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `interfaceName` | string | yes | The interface's simple name, e.g. 'ICodeAnalyzer'. An arity suffix ('IConsumer`1' / 'IConsumer<T>', or 'IConsumer`0' for the non-generic namesake) filters to that arity; a bare name keeps the merged view of every arity. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include test-project implementers (default false - production focus). |

### find_overrides

List the override-to-base relationships for methods of a given name - the class-inheritance counterpart to find_implementations (which covers interfaces). Each row pairs an overriding method with the nearest ancestor in its base-class chain that declares the virtual/abstract method it overrides: 'Derived.M(params) overrides Base'.

One call answers both 'who overrides this virtual/abstract method?' (impact, before you change a base method) and 'what does this override?' (comprehension). For a type's base and derived types use get_type_hierarchy; for the callers of a method use find_usages.

Returns a capped envelope: items (the rows, sorted), count, totalFound, truncated - at most 100 rows. Empty items means no method of that name is an override. When the overridden base is a BCL/framework virtual outside the solution (object.ToString, Stream.Dispose) the row reads '... overrides (external base)'.

Types render in their DECLARATION FORM ('Strategy&lt;T>.M(...) overrides ResilienceStrategy&lt;TResult>', the render get_type_hierarchy uses), so a generic and a non-generic namesake stay separate rows. A row carries no namespace: two same-named types that differ only by namespace collapse into one row, so read a row as the relationship, not as one attributed type.

Read-only: it reads persisted facts and also works on a recalled session. Parameters: a qualified methodName ('Widget.ToString') matches nothing. There is no type filter, and each overload is a row of its own. An empty answer carries 'nearest' when a close declared method name exists - for a qualified methodName the bare method name.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `methodName` | string | yes | The method's exact (case-sensitive) simple name, e.g. 'ToString' or 'Dispose'. |

### find_resource_usages

Resource-key fan-in across the solution's XAML/AXAML markup AND its C# sources - the question the C# symbol graph cannot answer because resources are wired by string key, not by symbol. With a key: where it is DEFINED (x:Key, file:line), every REFERENCE (file:line + kind - 'static'/'dynamic' for the markup extension, since a theme-swapped brush must be dynamic, and 'code' for a C# string literal equal to the key), and same-file duplicate definitions (in a compiled resource dictionary a duplicate silently shadows a neighboring key; a same-named key in DIFFERENT files is usually a legitimate theme pair, so only same-file counts as a collision). Without a key: the audit view - every never-referenced key (deletion candidates; deleting a still-referenced key compiles clean and throws only at runtime) + all same-file collisions. Reads the CURRENT .xaml/.axaml/.cs files on disk (bin/obj/.vs excluded, same discovery as the analyzer) - never stale after an edit, no refresh_session needed, works on recalled sessions. STRING keys only (a structural x:Key="{x:Type ...}" is out of scope); the forms that name the key - {StaticResource ResourceKey=...} and the element &lt;StaticResource ResourceKey="..." /> - are read. XML-commented markup is ignored. Fan-in comes from TWO channels: the solution's markup ({StaticResource}/{DynamicResource}) and C# string literals equal to the key - the TryFindResource channel, reported as kind 'code' with its file:line because a matching literal is not by itself proof of a resource lookup (it may be a test assertion, or a doc-comment cref naming a same-named converter type). Still invisible: a key ASSEMBLED at runtime (interpolated or concatenated), a source file that is not .cs, and a third-party library template resolving the key from ITS OWN dll (e.g. a theme library's DynamicResource re-key) - zero references means 'verify before deleting', not proof. Lists capped at 200.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `key` | string \| null |  | The exact (case-sensitive) resource key, e.g. 'TextPrimaryBrush'. Omit for the audit view (never-referenced keys + same-file collisions). |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a view-path substring (e.g. 'AIContextBuilder.UI/') to narrow which files are reported. In the audit view the scope narrows the DEFINITIONS under audit; references still count solution-wide, so a key referenced outside the scope is not a false orphan. |

### find_symbol

Find types, methods, properties, fields, events, enum members and operators whose name contains the query (case-insensitive). Returns each match with kind ('type'/'method'/'property'/'field'/'event'/'enum_member'/'operator'), name, declaring type, namespace and a signature. Use this to locate a symbol before calling find_usages / call_graph / get_context - every kind listed here except 'operator' is one find_usages / impact_of_change resolve (an operator is located by its metadata name but carries no fan-in: 'a == b' is no invocation the call index records). Types are listed first, then methods, then properties (handwritten + source-generated - a generated property carries a '// source-generated' note in its signature), then fields, events and enum members (an enum member's signature is its qualified Enum.Member form, the string the fan-in tools take), then user-defined operators + conversions. A user-defined operator is found by its METADATA name (query 'op_Equality' / 'op_Addition' / 'op_Implicit'; 'op_' lists them all). Not indexed, so an empty answer is expected for them: local variables, parameters, labels, namespaces, and C# generated into obj/ that carries real declarations (protobuf/Grpc.Tools, T4, Refit) - a zero-hit answer on a solution that has such files says so in 'generatedSourcesNote'. Results are ranked by match quality FIRST - exact name, then case-insensitive exact, then prefix, then substring - and only within one rank by the kind order above; an exact match is therefore never hidden by the cap behind weaker substring hits (a symbol named 'Type' used to sit at position 1026 of 1102). Returns a capped envelope (items/count/totalFound/truncated), max 100 - if truncated, the exact/prefix matches are the ones you got; narrow the query (a longer substring) to see the weaker rest. If the query matches nothing, the response carries a 'nearest' suggestion - the closest declared symbol name (a likely typo/case-mismatch); a matched symbol never carries one.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `query` | string | yes | A substring of the symbol name to search for (type, method, property, field, event, enum member or operator). |

### find_tests_for

Find the test cases that likely cover a symbol: test methods that call it, read it, build it or are named after it. Static evidence, not a coverage run; coverage_gaps asks the opposite question for a scope.

Use it before changing a symbol, to see what pins it, and after, to pick tests to run. Only a method that itself carries a test attribute counts (by default Fact, Theory, Test, TestMethod, TestCase).

Returns items [{testType, testMethod, project, matchReason}], count, totalFound, truncated (at most 50), invokesTotal, dispatchTotal (omitted at 0) and an optional 'note' after the list. matchReason is one of nine tiers, in sort order: 'invokes' (the test calls the target), 'invokes-via' (through one method it calls), 'accesses' (it reads or writes the target property or field; for a type, a static one), 'accesses-via', 'constructs' (it builds the target type; type and constructor queries only), 'constructs-via', 'dispatch' (it calls an interface or abstract member the target implements; a test double may have run instead), 'dispatch-via' and 'name' (a guess: the test's or its class's name mentions the symbol - for Type.Member, both names). The first six are strong. invokesTotal counts the strong rows and dispatchTotal the contract rows over the whole result, so totalFound minus both is the name guesses.

The evidence reaches two hops at most - the test and one method it calls or getter of a property it reads - so a deeper chain is not counted, and an empty answer is not 'nothing pins this'. The 'note' says so on an empty answer, and names the other cases where numbers mislead: an undeclared name or type segment (every hit is name noise), an event or enum member (only the name tier can match), a nested type in the 'Outer.Inner' form, a constructor query, contract rows, construction rows (matched on the type's simple name, so a namesake counts too).

Read-only. symbol is case-sensitive: a type's simple name, a member name bare or as 'Type.Member' (only that type's member), or 'Type.Type' for the constructor.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbol` | string | yes | The type name, or the member name - bare or in the qualified Type.Member form - to find covering tests for. |

### find_unresolved_bindings

List silently broken XAML bindings: a {Binding X} whose root member does NOT exist on its confidently resolved DataContext view-model (typo, removed/renamed member, or wrong DataContext) - the defect class that NEITHER the compiler NOR render-smoke tests catch.

Use it after renaming or removing view-model members. It judges the ROOT member of a binding path only. To see where a member or a resource key is bound use find_binding_usages / find_resource_usages.

Covers WPF/WinUI .xaml (view-model via d:DesignInstance or a unique FooView->FooViewModel convention) and Avalonia .axaml ({Binding}/{CompiledBinding}, only via x:DataType). Conservative BY SKIPPING, and the skip is what carries the accuracy claim: a binding whose DataContext scope cannot be typed with certainty (ControlTemplate/Style, runtime DataContext, keyed resources, a DataType-less template unless - WPF only - its host's ItemsSource types it), or whose view-model has an unverifiable external base, is never flagged - a recall miss, never a false report. Source-generated ([ObservableProperty]/[RelayCommand]) and inherited members count as resolved. One false-report class was measured: a HierarchicalDataTemplate's own ItemsSource mis-pinned onto its content read 8/8 false on MahApps.Metro and is fixed + fixture-pinned (0 after). So read a hit as high-confidence evidence to verify at its file and line, not as proof.

Returns JSON: count and unresolvedBindings (view, viewModel, member, line; one entry per site), plus markupFilesScanned and bindingSitesInMarkup from a live disk walk, which tell a clean zero from 'no markup at all'. bindingSitesInMarkup is not the number judged: sitesJudged/sitesSkipped are 0 when no binding exists and null otherwise, with judgementNote explaining why the response layer cannot reconstruct them.

Read-only. The findings come from the LIVE analysis: call refresh_session after edits. A recalled DB snapshot reports none, and a 'note' says so when the session looks recalled.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |

### find_usages

List who uses a symbol: its direct fan-in in the solution. impact_of_change adds the transitive closure and a risk level; calls_external covers BCL and package members.

Use it before changing or deleting a symbol, and instead of grepping a C# name. What is listed depends on resolvedKind: 'type' - the types that reference it (a doc cref too, unmarked), plus markup views; 'method' - its callers, overloads unioned; 'property' or 'field' - its readers and writers; 'event' - its raisers, subscribers and unsubscribers; 'enum_member' - its references; 'constructor' (the form 'Type.Type') - the type's construction and injection sites, overloads unioned. Test-project users are included.

Returns symbol, resolvedKind and usedBy, a capped envelope (items, count, totalFound, truncated; at most 100). Optional members qualify it: 'note' ahead of the list (an empty answer on a resolved symbol, a constructor answer, or a run with a project whose core references did not resolve - every list is short), 'namesakes' (several declared types share the simple name; usedBy is their union), 'collision' (a bare name: a same-named symbol of another kind, not counted), 'viaContract' + 'viaContractNote' (a qualified method was credited the callers of the contracts it implements), 'selfReferences' (how many listed users of a member sit on its own type), 'textuallyInvisibleUsers' (listed users whose source never spells the name), 'nearest' (on 'not_found': a close declared name).

An empty usedBy on a resolved symbol is not proof of dead code: an entry point, DI, reflection, a source generator and unrecorded markup forms leave no reference. 'not_found' is not 'undeclared': an operator and a delegate type answer it too, and so does a qualified or nested ('Outer.Inner') type name, with the simple name as 'nearest'.

Read-only. symbol is case-sensitive. A type takes its simple name. A member takes 'Type.Member' for one type's, or a bare name: that answers for ONE kind, the first in the order above with users, unioned over its same-named members.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbol` | string | yes | The exact (case-sensitive) type, method, property, field, event or enum-member name - the qualified Type.Member form for a member - or 'Type.Type' for a type's CONSTRUCTOR (see the tool description: the answer is the type's construction/injection sites, overloads unioned). |

### get_context

Return a dense, token-budgeted AI-Builder-Markdown slice of the code around a symbol: the symbol's source plus its expanded neighborhood (direct dependencies + callees, depth 1). Pass a type or method simple name (use find_symbol first to disambiguate). budget caps the output in tokens (floored at 8000); omit for full bodies. The fastest single-symbol retrieval - prefer it over export_markdown (which renders the WHOLE solution) when you only need one symbol's context. Multi-TFM solutions are deduplicated to one logical project per name, keeping the NEWEST TFM's instance (matching find_symbol's view; export_markdown keeps the unfiltered per-TFM render). Need a CHOSEN environment of one symbol (callers / tests / implementations / quality)? use explain_symbol. Bundling a whole task from a natural-language goal? use pack_for_task (read) or prepare_task (edit-ready: + covering tests & siblings).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbol` | string | yes | The type or method simple name to center the slice on. |
| `budget` | integer \| null |  | Optional token budget (floored at 8000). Caps the slice TWO ways: it compacts/drops method bodies AND - when the expanded neighborhood still overflows - drops the least-relevant non-seed types entirely, ranked by closeness to the seed and in-slice fan-in. The seed itself is never dropped: it renders with its full source when that fits the budget, otherwise as STRUCTURE (identity, members, every method signature) with a leading note naming the measured size of the full-code render and the budget that holds it. A leading comment discloses how many types were dropped. Omitted, the slice still renders against a ceiling (the active MCP profile's token budget, else a ~10000-token default budget) that bounds the neighborhood; pass a value for a tighter slice. |
| `includeQualityMetrics` | boolean |  | When true, also emit the &lt;QUALITY_HOTSPOTS> section plus complexity=""/ce="" tag attributes for the sliced symbols (cyclomatic complexity, efferent coupling). Default false (leaner slice). Set true when reviewing code quality / picking refactor targets. |
| `lean` | boolean |  | Lean slice (default TRUE): drop the repeated &lt;AI_CONTEXT_SPEC> format-rules preamble and the &lt;AI_CONTEXT_META> block, and omit any enabled-but-empty graph section (the ones that would otherwise render just '- none'). On a focused single-symbol slice that boilerplate is >4x the actual signal. The PATH_LEGEND, COMPRESSION_LEGEND (decoding keys) and all non-empty sections are kept. Set false to get the full AI-Builder-MD document with the format contract. |

### get_diagnostics

Compiler errors and warnings without a build: every C# project of the session is compiled in memory, in seconds. list_insights reports design findings instead.

Use it after editing .cs files: refresh_session, THEN this - the diagnostics come from the session's snapshot, not from disk, and an answer known to be behind the disk leads with verdict:'stale'. After a restore or build call refresh_session(force: true): an unforced refresh can answer 'unchanged'.

Returns verdict (only when stale or inconclusive), projectsScanned, errorCount, warningCount, infoCount and diagnostics: at most 200 items (id, severity, message, location, category, project), while the counts cover the full set. A multi-targeted project reports a diagnostic once; #pragma-suppressed ones are excluded. No analyzer runs, the SDK's included; source generators that load do run.

Disclosures say what the counts leave out:
- incompleteProjects, incompleteRatio, suppressedDiagnosticsTotal: projects whose core references did not resolve (e.g. no targeting pack). Their diagnostics are counted, not listed. Read that total as a MAGNITUDE, not as one half of a ratio with errorCount. verdict:'inconclusive' + reliable:false fire only when a strict majority of projects is incomplete, because a judgement that triggers on every partly-restored solution is one a caller learns to ignore.
- cascadeFromIncomplete:true on an item: inherited from an incomplete project.
- generatedCodeGaps: code a source generator or the WPF markup compiler writes is missing.
- designTimeBuildFailures: MSBuild reported a failure loading a project (a warning reads alike); its compiler options may be incomplete.

Needs a live session (a recalled one is rejected); writes nothing. scope: 'solution' or a case-insensitive substring of an item's location - for a file under the solution folder its relative path, with the OS separator (backslash on Windows). It filters the ANSWER, not the work: every project is compiled either way. Use scope to save context tokens, never to save time.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `severityFloor` | string |  | Minimum severity to include: 'error', 'warning' (default), 'info', or 'hidden'. |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a file-path substring (e.g. 'MyApp.Core' or 'Settings.cs') that filters the RESULT. It is matched against a diagnostic's location as the answer prints it, so a directory separator is a backslash on Windows. It does not reduce the work: all projects are compiled either way (see the tool description) - it saves response tokens, not latency. |

### get_insight

Get the full detail of one insight (incl. the per-item Details list) by its id. Discover ids via list_insights (the producers that found issues). Ids are producer-level. An unknown/typo'd id is rejected with the known producer ids; a registered producer that found nothing this session reports that explicitly (distinct from a typo - list_insights lists only producers WITH findings, so a 0-finding id is not discoverable there). Details default to the top 20 items (a '(... and N more)' marker discloses the rest); pass maxDetails to raise that cap for a full per-item drill-down. Pass dbPath to use the active QualityProfile from that DB (same semantics as list_insights, incl. the explicit-layerProfile precedence). Triage-filtered like list_insights, on BOTH axes: detail lines removed by a suppression ('by design', DB + sidecar) or by a dismissal ('seen', solution record) are gone, and 'suppressedDetailCount' reports the two ADDED TOGETHER (absent = none) - so it is not a count of sidecar entries. A producer silenced outright reports as 'registered but 0 hits'.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `insightId` | string | yes | The producer-level insight id, e.g. 'quality-long-methods' (discover via list_insights; an unknown id is rejected WITH the known ids). |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional path to an AIContextBuilder SQLite DB. When set, producer thresholds + toggles come from that DB's active QualityProfile AND the configured default layer profile (DefaultLayerProfileName / per-solution) drives the layer-violation analysis (an explicit analyze_solution(layerProfile) wins). Omitted, the QualityProfile falls back to the server's default config DB (the GUI's, if resolved), else the default profile, and the layer profile to the config DB the session was analysed against - the one its renders read. |
| `maxDetails` | integer \| null |  | Optional cap on the returned Details list (default 20). Raise it (e.g. 200) for a full per-item drill-down of this insight; a '(... and N more)' marker still discloses any remainder beyond the value. Applies only to this call; ignored (default cap) when omitted or <= 0. |

### get_type_hierarchy

Walk one type's inheritance in both directions: baseChain upward, derivedTypes downward, plus the interfaces the type declares. The type-level counterpart to find_overrides; for the types that implement an interface use find_implementations.

Use it before changing a base class, to see every type that inherits the change.

Returns type, resolvedKind (the type's kind - class, record, struct, interface, enum - or 'not_found'), baseChain, interfaces and derivedTypes, a capped envelope (items, count, totalFound, truncated; at most 100). baseChain lists the nearest base first; when the chain leaves the solution the last entry NAMES the external base ('ObservableObject (external)'). derivedTypes is transitive, each entry reading 'Derived : DirectBase'; test-project types are included and not marked. interfaces holds what the type itself declares - one inherited through a base class is not repeated - and for an interface query its base interfaces. Every link is arity-qualified ('Foo&lt;T>' vs 'Foo').

Optional members ahead of the lists qualify them: 'mergedNamesakes' (several declared types share the simple name and the view merges them; they cannot be separated), 'separatedNamesakes' (derivations from a same-named type that is NOT the resolved one, typically a framework base shadowed by an in-solution namesake, were excluded and are counted here), 'hint' (an interface query: derivedTypes covers class inheritance only), 'note' (a project's core references did not resolve; the hierarchy is partial until restore or build, then refresh_session).

'not_found' answers three empty lists. It means no type of that name is declared in the solution - also for an external base, a delegate type, a namespace-qualified name, a nested 'Outer.Inner' form, or an arity suffix no declaration has. A trailing 'nearest' gives a close declared type name, for a qualified form the simple name.

Read-only; works on a recalled session. typeName is the simple name, case-sensitive. A bare name merges a generic type with its non-generic namesake.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `typeName` | string | yes | The type's exact (case-sensitive) simple name, e.g. 'GraphSectionRendererBase'. Add an arity suffix ('Repository&lt;T>' or 'Repository`1') to disambiguate a generic from a same-named non-generic type. |

### impact_of_change

Estimate the blast radius of changing a symbol: its direct users plus everything that depends on them, with a risk level. find_usages lists the direct users only.

Call it first, before any edit to a symbol other code names (a rename, a signature, a default value, a shared type): a compile checks names, not what a consumer assumes about a value.

Returns symbol, resolvedKind, directCount and transitiveCount (true totals, tests included; transitive includes direct), productionImpactCount (the transitive count without test projects), risk and directImpact, a capped envelope of at most 20. risk reads productionImpactCount: 0 none, 1-4 low, 5-20 medium, above 20 high. So a symbol only tests use answers risk 'none'; risk counts dependents, not what the change means. Where one dependency cycle dominates a high closure, a 'saturation' block leads the counts and risk reads the direct production fan-in.

Per kind: a type - the closure of the types that reference it; a method - its caller closure, following interface and abstract dispatch at every hop; a property, field, event or enum member - the code that touches it (transitiveCount equals directCount). A qualified method is credited the callers of the contract members it implements ('viaContract' + 'viaContractNote', as in find_usages).

A 'note' ahead of the counts marks the answers a bare number would mislead: directCount 0 on a resolved symbol (DI, reflection, a source generator or markup may still reach it), a run with unresolved core references (every count is short), productionImpactCount 0 on a solution whose projects are all tests, and 'not_found' (risk 'none' is then no measurement; 'nearest' gives a close declared name). Next, 'collision' names a same-named symbol of another kind, not counted.

Read-only. symbol is case-sensitive and resolves as in find_usages: a type by its simple name, a member bare (one kind, same-named members unioned) or as 'Type.Member'. The constructor form 'Type.Type' is not resolved here: use find_usages or instantiation_sites.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbol` | string | yes | The exact (case-sensitive) type, method, property, field, event or enum-member name to assess - or the qualified Type.Member form for a member. |

### init_solution_config

Collect the raw material for the guided setup of a solution's Layer Profile, Exclude-Namespaces and Test Profile - step 1 of 2; apply_solution_config is the step that writes.

Use it when solution_config_status or the configInit hint of analyze_solution reports an axis as not initialized, or when check_solution_config_drift reports one as stale. Propose a mapping from the returned material, then call apply_solution_config with it. To only see what is configured, use solution_config_status.

Returns JSON: solutionPath; declaredNamespaces - the solution's own namespaces, the source for layer-mapping rules (test-project and framework namespaces are left out); referencedNamespaces - every namespace a using directive names, the solution's OWN included: only the external/framework ones are exclusion material, never exclude your own; testProjects - what the default heuristic classifies as test projects; detectedTestAttributes - the test attributes present in the code; proposalFormat - the JSON shape apply_solution_config expects. The first three lists are capped envelopes (items/count/totalFound/truncated, max 300); detectedTestAttributes is a plain array.

Read-only: it writes no configuration and no DB row and marks nothing as initialized. It walks the warm session workspace (no re-analysis), so it needs a live session; a recalled one is rejected with an error.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |

### install_agent_hooks

Install the aicb symbol guard into this project for an agent harness, so a C#-symbol question is REFUSED on a text search and redirected to the tool that answers it. Writes the guard script plus the harness's wiring entry (.claude/settings.json, .codex/hooks.json or opencode.json) and nothing else - no .mcp.json, no skills, and only inside the directory of the session's own solution. Omit 'harness' to install for the harness that is calling. An existing guard or wiring is kept unless force=true. Restart or reconnect the client afterwards, then call refresh_session so the session stops reporting the guard as missing.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `harness` | string \| null |  | Which harness to install for: claude-code, codex or opencode. Omit to use the harness the calling MCP client belongs to. |
| `force` | boolean |  | Overwrite an existing guard script and rewrite an existing wiring entry. |

### instantiation_sites

Find where a type is constructed and where it is injected: the narrow 'who creates or obtains an instance of X?' that find_usages (every reference) cannot answer. resolve_injection answers the other half - what is registered for a type.

Use it before changing a constructor, and to see whether anything but a test builds a type.

'created': a method, constructor or accessor that runs 'new X(...)', a target-typed new or a record 'with'; a field or property initializer is attributed to the constructor the compiler runs it in, so such a site is named '.ctor' ('.cctor' for a static one). 'injected': a type that takes X as a constructor parameter - no container is consulted. A parameter wrapped in another type (IEnumerable&lt;X>, Lazy&lt;X>) is recorded under the outer type, and an array of X is not a creation of X.

Returns typeName, a 'note' when there is one, createdByCount, createdByTests, injectedIntoCount, injectedIntoTests, sites - at most 200 items (name, declaringType, namespace, kind, isTestProject), created sites first - and 'nearest'. The four counts are true totals within scope. Test-project sites are included, not filtered: isTestProject marks each, and createdByTests == createdByCount with a non-zero total means every recorded construction site is in a test project. A type the DI container builds has no recorded production site, so that reading is not proof.

A 'note' covers two zeros: with no site at all it names the construction paths this fact cannot see and the markup views naming the type; with injectedIntoCount 0 it names those of its interfaces something is injected under - a DI consumer takes the interface, so query that name. 'nearest' gives a close declared name when no site was found and the name matches no declaration.

Read-only; works on a recalled session. typeName is matched on its simple name: namespace and generic arguments are dropped, namesakes are unioned, and an external type ('List', 'HttpClient') is a valid query. scope is 'solution' or a namespace prefix on the SITE's namespace.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `typeName` | string | yes | The type whose instantiation/injection sites to find (simple name; namespace + generic args are normalized away, e.g. 'OrderService' or 'List'). |
| `scope` | string |  | 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix (e.g. 'MyApp.Core') to narrow which sites are scanned. |

### list_insights

List code-quality / async / design-smell insights for a session (long methods, fat interfaces, unused types, missing async suffixes, many-parameter methods, ...). Runs against the live analyzed solution; each insight is aggregated per producer with a Details list. Pass dbPath to use the active QualityProfile (producer thresholds + toggles) from that DB; omit it for the default profile (DB-free). Honors the session's active test-detection profile (resolved by analyze_solution(dbPath)) for the production-focused producers. An explicit analyze_solution(layerProfile) drives the layer-violation insight and wins over the DB-configured profile (same precedence as solution_metrics and the CLI gate). THIS ANSWER IS TRIAGE-FILTERED, on BOTH triage axes: findings the solution marked intentional (a suppression - in the DB or in the git-tracked &lt;Solution>.aicb.json sidecar) AND findings a user dismissed as seen (in the solution record, NOT in the sidecar) are removed, and an insight whose findings are all gone does not appear at all. Every insight that lost lines carries 'suppressed' with the count of what BOTH axes removed together (absent = nothing filtered), so a shrinking number is never mistaken for a codebase that improved - but do not read that count as a sidecar entry count, because some of it is dismissal. Note 'title' is producer text computed BEFORE filtering, so on a partially filtered insight it still names the pre-filter total - 'detailsCount' + 'suppressed' are the real split. 'remediationCostMinutes' is a coarse order-of-magnitude estimate from fixed per-finding rules, not measured effort.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional path to an AIContextBuilder SQLite DB. When set, producer thresholds + toggles come from that DB's active QualityProfile AND the configured default layer profile (DefaultLayerProfileName / per-solution) drives the layer-violation analysis (an explicit analyze_solution(layerProfile) wins). Omitted, the QualityProfile falls back to the server's default config DB (the GUI's, if resolved), else the default profile, and the layer profile to the config DB the session was analysed against - the one its renders read. |

### list_mcp_profiles

List the MCP profiles in the server's config DB - each with its id, name, the slots that have a template assigned (General appears exactly when a profile-wide template is set), the profile-wide templateId (null = none), whether it carries a skill, its effective tool-set (toolSelection: the class-level CSV, or a 'methods:'-prefixed function-name list when the profile curates individual tool functions; null = lean core), whether it is the active one, AND the render config it applies (tokenBudget / outputFormat / overflowPolicy - a null tokenBudget/overflowPolicy means inherit: the template then the active PipelineProfile decides). Requires the server to be started with --db-path. Use the ids with 'aicb mcp --mcp-profile &lt;id>' to pin the profile at server start - that is the only way to change it; there is no runtime switch tool.

### list_skills

The server's capability map: a tools INDEX naming EVERY tool this server has - each exactly once, grouped into three lists by pool state (inPool.core = the tools every profile exposes, in reach-for-them order; inPool.extras = the rest of the active pool, alphabetical; outOfPool = exists but the active tool set does not expose it) - plus the sections that group them by name: the always-on navigation CORE (listed in no menu because it needs none), the task FACETS (id + guidance + template slot + the facet's tool menu), the cross-cutting guidance styles, and the legacy functional skill bundles. Use it to discover specialized long-tail tools (e.g. get_insight, find_by_concurrency_risk, coverage_gaps, find_unresolved_bindings) beyond that core - and to check whether ANY tool you want is merely in outOfPool rather than nonexistent. Tools outside the active pool become reachable via an MCP profile whose facet menu or bundle names them (see list_mcp_profiles / 'aicb mcp --mcp-profile &lt;id>'), or via the AICB_MCP_TOOLS override. By default the answer omits the per-tool descriptions, which is what makes it cheap; pass detail="full" when you need them. No session needed.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `detail` | string \| null |  | How much per-tool text to include: "lean" (default) - bare names in their pool groups; "full" - additionally each tool's one-line description. Case-insensitive. |

### measure

Report how BIG a read-only query's answer would be - its exact token count - WITHOUT returning the answer. Use it to decide before you pull: whether a call is worth making, what 'budget' to pass a slice tool (get_context/explain_symbol/pack_for_task), or whether to narrow 'scope' first. Same shape as batch: pass the shared session_id once plus 'queries', an array of {tool, args} where 'args' is that tool's own arguments WITHOUT the sessionId. Example: queries=[{"tool":"explain_symbol","args":{"symbol":"OrderService","include":["callees"]}}] → {tool, ok, tokens, chars, returned, totalFound, truncated, budgetNote}. 'tokens' is the real tokenizer count (cl100k_base) of the exact text the tool would return; 'returned/totalFound/truncated' are passed through when the tool answers with a capped envelope, so you also see whether you would be seeing everything. The Markdown slice tools (get_context / explain_symbol / pack_for_task) have no such envelope - they disclose budget pruning in prose, so 'budgetNote' carries that disclosure verbatim: if it says types were dropped, the answer you are pricing is already CUT (an axis you asked for can be missing entirely), and a larger 'budget' is what buys it back. IMPORTANT: measure does NOT make the query cheaper to RUN - the server does the full work either way; it makes the answer cheap to INSPECT (you pay ~50 tokens instead of the answer). So measure to DECIDE, then call once - do not measure every call by reflex. Dispatches the same read-only tools as batch, and refuses the same ones for the same four reasons - mutation is only the first of them; the refusal message names which one applies. Like batch, sub-queries follow the ACTIVE POOL: an out-of-pool tool is refused per item. Max 16 queries per call.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. Shared by ALL queries - do NOT repeat it inside each query's args. |
| `queries` | array | yes | The read-only queries to measure: an array of { tool, args } objects, exactly as for batch. Max 16. |

### pack_for_task

Goal-driven context packing: given a natural-language task, seed on every symbol the goal names (type or method), expand the neighborhood, and return a token-budgeted AI-Builder-Markdown bundle - with goal-aware trimming that keeps the most task-relevant methods when the budget is tight. Name the symbols you care about in the goal (e.g. 'refactor OrderService.Cancel and Validate'). budget caps output tokens (floored at 8000). Multi-TFM solutions are deduplicated to one logical project per name (NEWEST TFM's instance, matching find_symbol's view). For an EDIT-ready bundle that also pulls in the covering tests + naming/file siblings (and, on a profile-aware server, renders through the facet's template), use prepare_task instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `goal` | string | yes | The task description (name the relevant types/methods in it). Once the goal names a symbol exactly, its other words only steer the trimming and seed nothing of their own; a goal naming no symbol is matched by name segments instead ('cancel order' -> CancelOrder). |
| `budget` | integer \| null |  | Optional token budget (floored at 8000). Caps the slice TWO ways: it compacts/drops method bodies AND - when the expanded neighborhood still overflows - drops the least-relevant non-seed types entirely. Exact type names and exact method names with one owner are pinned; broad subword/ambiguous same-name families may be capped by closeness and in-slice fan-in. A leading comment discloses how many types were dropped. Omitted, the bundle still renders against a ceiling (the active MCP profile's token budget, else a ~10000-token default budget) that bounds the neighborhood; pass a value for a tighter bundle. |
| `includeQualityMetrics` | boolean |  | When true, also emit the &lt;QUALITY_HOTSPOTS> section plus complexity=""/ce="" tag attributes (cyclomatic complexity, efferent coupling) for the packed symbols. Default false. Set true when the task is a refactor/quality pass. |
| `lean` | boolean |  | Lean slice (default TRUE): drop the repeated &lt;AI_CONTEXT_SPEC>/&lt;AI_CONTEXT_META> preamble and omit enabled-but-empty graph sections ('- none'). Keeps PATH_LEGEND / COMPRESSION_LEGEND and all non-empty sections. Set false for the full AI-Builder-MD document. |
| `facet` | string \| null |  | Optional facet - the task axis of this call: General, Exploration, Refactoring, Debugging, Review, Testing, Documentation, Architecture, or Performance. pack_for_task always renders the lean bundle (its render deliberately stays template-free - use prepare_task for a template-shaped bundle); the facet appends a short work-style trailer with suggested next tools. (The name 'slot' is accepted too.) |

### prepare_task

Build an EDIT-ready context bundle for a task goal: the source of the symbols the goal names, their dependency neighborhood, the test methods that cover them and 1-2 naming/file-convention siblings (the test, the factory, the validator you'd otherwise miss) - as one token-budgeted AI-Builder-MD document.

Prefer this over pack_for_task when you're about to EDIT, not just read. pack_for_task packs the goal-seeded neighborhood alone, without covering tests and siblings. For one symbol use get_context or explain_symbol; for blast radius and test coverage as numbers use review_context.

Returns text, not JSON. It starts with a manifest comment (goal | seeds | tests | siblings | render) so you can see what was covered - and what was NOT ((none)); after a source edit a staleness comment precedes it. 'render' names the path that produced the body. 'template' is the default, because a plain 'aicb mcp' resolves the standard config DB: the chosen facet's template (graphs, detail, line numbers, quality) in the active profile's notation - YAML under the built-in profiles. 'lean' is the fallback of a server without a config DB: tag Markdown. Multi-TFM solutions are deduplicated to one logical project per name (NEWEST TFM's instance, matching find_symbol's view).

Read-only. Parameters: a tight budget drops neighborhood types, tests and siblings first. A type the goal names, or the one owner of a method it names, is never dropped (too large, it renders as structure: members and signatures); the owners of a method name several types share can be dropped. A leading note names the drops. lean and includeQualityMetrics act on the lean render only, so not on a default server.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `goal` | string | yes | The task description - name the relevant types/methods in it (e.g. 'refactor OrderService.Cancel and its validation'). Once the goal names a symbol exactly, its other words only steer the trimming and seed nothing of their own; a goal naming no symbol is matched by name segments instead ('cancel order' -> CancelOrder). |
| `facet` | string \| null |  | Optional facet to work under - the task axis of this call: General (default), Exploration, Refactoring, Debugging, Review, Testing, Documentation, Architecture, or Performance. On a server with a config DB (the default: a plain 'aicb mcp' resolves the standard one) the facet's template shapes the render; it always appends a short work-style trailer with suggested next tools. (The former name 'slot' is still accepted.) |
| `budget` | integer \| null |  | Optional token budget (floored at 8000). Applies to BOTH the lean and the profile-aware template render path: it compacts/drops method bodies AND drops the least-relevant types when the neighborhood overflows. A type the goal names, and the one owner of a method name it names, is never dropped - one whose own source does not fit renders as structure (members and signatures). The owners of a method name several types share are capped like the neighborhood: some are reduced to structure, some dropped. The bundled covering tests/siblings are BUDGET-BOUND - under a tight budget they are dropped to fit (a leading comment names the drops so you can ask for one by name). Overrides any MCP-profile/template token budget. Omitted, the bundle still renders against a ceiling (the MCP profile's token budget, else the facet template's, else a ~10000-token default budget) that bounds the neighborhood. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include the test methods that cover the seeded symbols (default true). |
| `includeSiblings` | boolean |  | Include 1-2 naming/file-convention siblings of the seeded types (default true). |
| `includeQualityMetrics` | boolean |  | When true, also emit the &lt;QUALITY_HOTSPOTS> section plus complexity=""/ce="" tag attributes for the bundled symbols (lean path). Default false. Set true for a refactor/quality pass. |
| `lean` | boolean |  | Lean slice (default TRUE): on the lean-render path, drop the repeated &lt;AI_CONTEXT_SPEC>/&lt;AI_CONTEXT_META> preamble and omit enabled-but-empty graph sections ('- none'); keeps PATH_LEGEND / COMPRESSION_LEGEND, the manifest and all non-empty sections. Set false for the full AI-Builder-MD document. (Ignored on the profile-aware slot-template render path, which the active profile controls.) |

### refresh_session

Re-analyze the session's solution after YOUR code edits - call it once you have changed .cs files, otherwise find_usages / impact_of_change / list_insights / get_context may keep answering from the STALE pre-edit graph (a silent source of wrong results). Cheap to call speculatively: a W0 file-set-hash check skips the expensive Roslyn re-run when nothing actually changed, and a C# file whose timestamp moved while its text stayed the snapshot's (a save without an edit) does not count as a change either. That check reads SOURCE files, so it cannot see a restore or build - after one of those, an analysis that reported unresolved references retries once by itself, and 'force' is the deterministic way to demand it. Reuses the warm workspace. Returns { changed, reason, session, mode } - 'mode' names the path the re-analysis took ('incremental' = document texts replayed into the warm snapshot without an MSBuild reload, else 'full-reload') and is absent when nothing was re-analyzed. The incremental path can stop engaging without any visible symptom - answers stay correct, calls just get slow again - so 'mode' is how you notice.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `force` | boolean |  | Re-analyze even when no source file has changed. Use it after a restore/build that was meant to repair unresolved references - those live in build output the file-set hash does not cover, so an ordinary call can legitimately answer 'unchanged'. Costs a full MSBuild reload; leave false for the normal after-an-edit refresh. |

### resolve_injection

Resolve a Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection registration: the implementation(s) registered for a service, each with its lifetime and registration site.

Use it for 'what do I get when this is injected, and in which host?' - not 'is it used' (find_usages), 'who implements it' (find_implementations) or 'where is it built' (instantiation_sites).

It reads Add{Singleton,Scoped,Transient}, TryAdd* and project-local wrappers ending in a lifetime, plus a foreach over a static table of new(typeof(Service), typeof(Impl)) rows. Keyed calls keep their key (two keys = two services); open-generic is read. Not read: ServiceDescriptor adds, AddHttpClient-style helpers, Scrutor, other containers.

Returns JSON: registrations (serviceType, implementationType [= serviceType for a self or instance registration], lifetime, note, location, project, declaringMethod, key) and: multiRegistration / registrationSites (one per host is normal); ambiguous (ONE site registers several implementations under one key, not consumed as a collection); effectiveRegistration (2+ registration calls: winner = what a single-service resolve gets, the last one kept, read only within ONE straight-line site; else winner null plus the reason, e.g. several sites); consumedAsCollection; constructorConsumerCount (types taking it as a plain constructor parameter - visibility, never a usage verdict); optionalDependencies (constructors taking it as an OPTIONAL parameter, each judged yes/no/unknown).

An empty list says why: resolvedKind 'not_found' plus 'nearest' = the name matches nothing; on an unfiltered query a 'note' names what could not be read (a runtime service type, an unnamed factory product, a foreign container) - empty WITH a note means 'not statically visible', never 'not registered'.

Read-only; needs a live session. Test-project registrations and consumers count only with includeTests=true; testRegistrationsFiltered counts what that hid. interface is the SERVICE type (an interface, or a class registered as itself); site narrows by file path.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `interface` | string | yes | The interface simple or fully-qualified name, e.g. 'ICodeAnalyzer'. |
| `site` | string \| null |  | Optional: narrow to registrations whose file path contains this substring. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | Include registrations declared in test projects (default false - production focus). |

### review_context

Assemble review context for a set of changed symbols in ONE call: per symbol its fan-in, the transitive change impact with a risk level, the types that implement it (if an interface) and the test methods that likely cover it. It bundles what find_usages, impact_of_change, find_implementations and find_tests_for answer one symbol at a time.

Use this before reviewing or refactoring to see blast radius + test coverage at a glance. It does not name the callers (use find_usages or impact_of_change for that list) and returns no code (use explain_symbol).

Returns a JSON array ordered by symbol NAME - index it by 'symbol', never by request position. Per entry: symbol, resolvedKind, directUsages, transitiveImpact, risk (none/low/medium/high), implementations (names; test doubles are listed too, find_implementations filters them by default), coveringTests (testType, testMethod, project, matchReason), coveringTestsTotal, coveringTestsTruncated. An unresolved name reads resolvedKind 'not_found' with a 'note' and no risk. For a bare name several types share, the counts are their union and no note says so - find_usages names the namesakes.

'coveringTests' is find_tests_for's list: strongest evidence first, capped at 50 per symbol. The cap keeps the 50 strongest rows: name guesses go first, strong rows too once there are more than 50. find_tests_for stops at the same 50, so narrow the symbol rather than re-query. 'invokesTotal' (strong rows) and 'dispatchTotal' (rows reaching the symbol through an interface or abstract member) count the WHOLE list and can exceed the rows shown; coveringTestsTotal minus both is the name guesses. For a qualified method, directUsages and transitiveImpact include callers credited through such a member - see 'viaContract' / 'viaContractNote'.

Read-only. Parameters: symbols must not be empty and takes the strings find_usages resolves - a type's simple name, or a member bare or as Type.Member.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbols` | array | yes | The changed type/method names to assemble review context for. |

### save_session

Persist the current session's analyzed model as a named Manual snapshot in an aicb DB, so a later session can diff against it with compare_with_previous.

Use it BEFORE a bulk mechanical change (a rename sweep, a signature migration) and call compare_with_previous afterwards. An ordinary edit needs no snapshot: git diff and the tests cover it.

Returns JSON: snapshotId, sessionId, solutionId, name, lineNumbersAvailable and totalSnapshots (the snapshots that DB now holds for this solution).

It writes to the aicb DB, not to the solution's source or configuration: one new snapshot row, plus the solution's record when the DB does not know the solution yet; a DB file that does not exist is created. Nothing is overwritten: every call adds a snapshot under a fresh id, and name is a label, not a key. Note: snapshots lose line numbers (StartLine/EndLine) on the DB round-trip.

Parameters: sessionId is a live or recalled session's id or an absolute .sln path. Omit dbPath to use the server's standard config DB (the same one the GUI uses); when the server resolved none, the call fails with 'dbPath is required'.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id whose current state to snapshot. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable name for this snapshot (e.g. 'before refactor'). |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional absolute path to the aicb SQLite DB to persist into. Omit to use the server's standard config DB. |

### server_info

Report this SERVER's own identity and health: name, version, build commit, the config DB's schema version, and drift warnings about the server binary. Needs no session - a reachability smoke-check.

Call it first after connecting and after an update or restart: the commit answers the question the version number cannot - 'is the binary I am talking to built from the code I just landed?'. It says nothing about a solution's configuration (solution_config_status: what is active; check_solution_config_drift: does it still fit the code), about which tools exist (list_skills) or about how they were used (usage_report).

Returns plain text, not JSON. Line 1 is the identity: 'aicb MCP server (AIContextBuilder) v&lt;version> (commit &lt;sha>)'. Compare the commit against `git rev-parse HEAD` (the full sha is reported, so a short hash is a prefix of it): one version number can cover DIFFERENT builds. A build with no resolvable git revision omits the commit. 'Config DB schema: user_version=N (&lt;path>)' follows when a config DB is resolved.

Then, only when they apply: ANALYZER DRIFT - this build's commit against the HEAD of the repo holding the analyzed solution; it also reports in-sync and ahead, and is silent without an analyzed session and on a repo that does not know this commit (any foreign solution). SCHEMA DRIFT - the config DB's schema is newer than this binary: rebuild or reinstall. PENDING MIGRATION - the reverse: the DB is older; the line says how to migrate it. TOOL POOL DRIFT - the active profile lists tools this binary does not register: a newer build wrote it (rebuild or reinstall) or the tool was retired (re-save the profile). That check is tool-NAME level; a new parameter on an existing tool is not detected, the commit is the finer signal. CONFIG DRIFT - the active MCP profile changed since this server started: restart or reconnect to load the current tools and instructions.

Read-only: it reads the config DB's schema version and, for the analyzer line, queries git in the analyzed solution's repository.

### solution_config_status

Check whether a solution's Layer Profile, Exclude-Namespaces and Test Profile have been initialized via the guided setup, and which Layer Profile / Exclusion List / Test Profile is currently active. 'initialized' is an explicit marker for all three slots (stamped by apply_solution_config - it is NOT inferred from having an active id, which a user can also set manually via the Settings panel); the testProfile slot additionally reports the effective per-solution active test-detection profile. Pass the session_id; dbPath is optional - omit it to use the server's default config DB (the same one the GUI uses), if the server resolved one. Each slot names the config IN FORCE for the analysis - resolved exactly as analyze_solution resolves it - and its source: 'db' (the per-solution row or the app-global default), 'sidecar' (the committed .aicb.json applies, which it does whenever the DB configured nothing for the axis - a built-in default is not configuration), 'built-in' (the built-in exclusion list, applied when nothing configured one and no sidecar names one) or 'none' (the heuristic). A repo with a valid .aicb.json sidecar but no DB row reads initialized=true, source:sidecar, not a misleading uninitialized. Use this on solution start: if a slot is not initialized, offer to run init_solution_config + apply_solution_config.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Absolute path to the aicb config/master SQLite DB that holds the per-solution configuration. Omit to use the server's default config DB (the same one the GUI uses), if the server resolved one. |

### solution_metrics

The solution-wide quality rollup in one call - the numbers the CLI '--fail-on' quality gate evaluates. symbol_metrics ranks single methods; list_insights shows the findings behind the severity counts.

Use it for a before/after number, or to try a gate expression.

Returns metrics {typeCount, methodCount, complexityMax, complexityAvg, methodsOverComplexityThreshold, ceMax, caMax}, scope (always 'production'), testMethodCount, testTypeCount, severities {critical, warning, info, ok}, debtMinutes, debtApprox, debtRating, complexityThreshold, qualityProfile, layerProfile (when one is in force), knownGateMetrics and, with failOn, gate {expression, passed, violatedClauses}. degradedProducers appears when an insight producer failed; severities and debt are then incomplete. debtMinutes is a coarse estimate from fixed per-finding rules, not measured effort; debtApprox rounds it (1 d = 8 h).

PRODUCTION code only - test projects, per the session's test profile, are excluded from every number, and testMethodCount / testTypeCount give the excluded side. Types are logical (partial fragments merged, multi-TFM deduplicated); methods exclude constructors and accessors. methodsOverComplexityThreshold counts STRICTLY greater than complexityThreshold, while symbol_metrics' minComplexity is inclusive. ceMax / caMax: coupling maxima (caMaxNote: same-named types could raise caMax). severities count insights - one per producer that found something - not findings. The rollup is NOT triage-filtered: suppressed and dismissed findings still count, as in the CLI gate, so debt and severities can be higher than what list_insights shows.

failOn is evaluated over the tokens in knownGateMetrics; the gate is advisory - the blocking gate stays the CLI.

Profiles: the active QualityProfile of the config DB in force (see dbPath); the session's layer profile, else the one dbPath (or, omitted, the session's analysis DB) configures. Writes nothing, but a quality DB behind this binary's schema is migrated on open. Works on a recalled session.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `failOn` | string \| null |  | Optional quality-gate expression to evaluate against the rollup (CLI '--fail-on' syntax, e.g. 'critical>0 OR debt>120min OR ce-max>50'). An invalid expression or unknown metric is rejected with the known tokens. |
| `dbPath` | string \| null |  | Optional path to an AIContextBuilder SQLite DB. When set, the complexity threshold and producer toggles come from that DB's active QualityProfile (same semantics as list_insights); omit to fall back to the server's default config DB (the GUI's, if resolved), else the default profile. Omitted, the layer profile comes from the config DB the session was analysed against. |

### symbol_metrics

Report method complexity: McCabe CYCLOMATIC complexity (independent paths) and COGNITIVE complexity (how hard the method is to follow: nesting is penalised, boolean-operator runs collapse), plus the parameter count - for one method by name, or as a ranking of the hotspots. solution_metrics gives the solution-wide rollup.

Use it before touching an unfamiliar method, and to find where the complexity sits. Both metrics measure CODE SHAPE, not runtime cost; for a hot path use a profiler.

With symbol (mode 'symbol'): every method unit of that exact, case-sensitive name - bare for all same-named ones, 'Type.Member' for one type's. scope, includeTests, minComplexity and rankByCognitive are ignored. Accessors, constructors and operators answer by metadata name ('get_Items', '.ctor', 'op_Equality'); '.ctor' is every constructor unit of the solution, 'Type..ctor' one type's. Without symbol (mode 'ranked'): methods only, sorted by cyclomatic complexity descending - by cognitive with rankByCognitive=true - and filtered to complexity >= minComplexity (inclusive; 0 = no floor).

Returns scope, mode, metricMeaning, minComplexity, methodsScanned, methods - at most 200 items (name, declaringType, namespace, cyclomaticComplexity, cognitiveComplexity, parameterCount) - and when they apply 'note', minComplexityBoundary, 'nearest' (a close declared name when a lookup matched no method) and testMethodsFiltered. In a ranking, test-project methods are excluded by default (includeTests=true includes them); testMethodsFiltered counts those that cleared the floor, and the note names the strongest one when it would have ranked inside the shown list. The note also says when the two axes would have listed different methods.

An empty ranking means nothing cleared the floor - or the scope matched nothing: methodsScanned 0 is the only sign. An empty lookup means no METHOD of that name; a bare property or type name gets a note saying so.

Read-only; works on a recalled session.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbol` | string \| null |  | Exact (case-sensitive) method name to report - bare (every same-named method) or in the qualified Type.Member form (that type's member only). Omit to rank all methods by complexity. |
| `minComplexity` | integer |  | When ranking (no symbol): only include methods whose ranking complexity (cyclomatic, or cognitive when rankByCognitive=true) >= this. 0 (default) = no filter. |
| `scope` | string |  | When ranking: 'solution' (default) or a namespace prefix to narrow scope. Ignored when symbol is given. |
| `includeTests` | boolean |  | When ranking: include test-project methods (default false - production hotspots; CC-heavy test harnesses would otherwise skew the top-N). Ignored in the by-name symbol lookup (which always returns the named method). |
| `rankByCognitive` | boolean |  | When ranking: rank + filter by COGNITIVE complexity instead of cyclomatic (default false). Both numbers are always present per method; this only changes the sort + minComplexity axis. Ignored in the by-name symbol lookup. |

### symbol_signature

Return a symbol's signature(s) WITHOUT the body: the type declaration, the method/operator signature or a member's declaration (property, field, event, enum member - the last as its qualified Enum.Member form), plus its XML &lt;summary> doc and its declaring file + start line - for understanding an API without reading the whole file/body, and for navigating straight to it. 'file' is the fragment's OWN file (for a partial type a method points at the file the METHOD lives in, not at the first type fragment); it is omitted only when the snapshot carries no path, and a member's 'line' is null (no line fact is modeled for members). Exact (case-sensitive) name match; multiple results for overloads or name collisions. A member also takes 'Type.Member' (that type's only) and a type a qualified name ('Ns.Type', 'Outer.Inner'). A user-defined operator matches by its METADATA name ('op_Equality' / 'op_Implicit' / ...). Leaner than get_context (which returns the full source). Returns a capped envelope (items/count/totalFound/truncated), max 50. Matching is EXACT, so a typo or case-mismatch returns an empty list rather than an error - when nothing matched, the response therefore carries a 'nearest' suggestion (the closest declared name), which distinguishes 'you spelled it differently' from 'this symbol genuinely has no signature' - and, where the run skipped generated C# under obj/, a 'generatedSourcesNote' naming the third possibility: the declaration exists in code this index never read.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | yes | The session_id returned by analyze_solution. Also takes an absolute .sln/.slnx/.slnf path, analyzed on first use. |
| `symbol` | string | yes | The exact (case-sensitive) type, method, property, field, event, enum-member or operator name (e.g. 'op_Equality'), bare or qualified ('Type.Member', 'Ns.Type'). |

### usage_report

Report the server-side tool-call telemetry: what the CallTool filter recorded into the config DB's tool_calls table, across every client that used this DB - not this conversation's transcript. list_skills shows the pool; this shows what was called.

Use it to see how heavily, how reliably and at what cost each tool is used. READ THE SCOPE FIRST: the filter sits on the tools/call pipeline. A one-shot `aicb call` writes the same row under the client name 'aicb-call' when given a --db-path, and nothing without one. A sub-query inside batch or measure records the PARENT call and no child row - measured with a planted probe. So every count here is a LOWER BOUND, and a tool at 0 was not called THROUGH THIS DOOR rather than not called. A batch parent's row does carry a tally of its sub-queries, returned as subQueries: read it before calling a tool unused.

Returns totals (totalCalls, errorCalls, errorRatePct, distinctTools, distinctSessions, firstTs, lastTs, clients, serverVersions); tools, ranked by calls, each with errors, duration (ms) and result size (chars) as average, p50, p90 and max, plus - when non-zero - errorClasses (exception type names; McpException is a failure the tool raised on purpose), argumentBindingErrors (the caller named an argument the tool does not have) and aliasApplied; protocolVersions and clientEras (who called, on which protocol revision); facets; subQueries; recordedVia; and poolCoverage (poolSize, poolToolsFired, poolToolsNeverCalled, outOfPoolTools). Read coverage THERE, not from distinctTools: that figure counts every tool called including ones outside the pool, so holding it against the pool size overstates coverage.

The answer carries shapes only - names, counts, exception type names - no code, no argument values and no session reference. Without a readable config DB it answers available:false.

Read-only and session-less. sinceDays narrows every figure to the last N days (1..3650, so 0 means one day; omit it for the whole log); the cutoff comes back as windowSinceIso.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `topTools` | integer |  | Cap on the per-tool breakdown, ranked by call count (default 30; clamped to 1..200). |
| `sinceDays` | integer \| null |  | Only count calls from the last N days (omit for the whole log; clamped to 1..3650). |

### verify_claim

Verify a structured claim about a change by diffing two analyzed sessions (baseline → changed). Supported claim types (MVP): 'no_new_api' (no types/methods were ADDED AND no method signatures changed) and 'symbol_removed_unused' (the named symbol was removed AND had no usages in the baseline's static fan-in graph). Returns a verdict of confirmed / refuted / indeterminate with a reason + evidence. NOTE THE SCOPE OF 'no_new_api': it is about ADDITIONS and SIGNATURE CHANGES, so a REMOVAL does not refute it - a change set that only deletes public API is legitimately 'confirmed'. Removals are therefore never silent: the reason states the boundary and every removal the same diff records is listed as evidence, prefixed '-'. For the removal question ask verify_claim(symbol_removed_unused), or diff_public_contract (outside the default profile's pool). Conservative in BOTH directions: what the diff cannot prove is never falsely confirmed - and never falsely refuted either, because 'was not removed' is a claim about the change that is only made once the string resolves to something this diff could report on. A name that resolves to nothing, a property/field/event/enum member (the diff models types and methods only), and the simple name of a removed type the diff had to render by its FULL name because it is ambiguous, each return 'indeterminate' naming that cause - not a confident 'was not removed'. A removed method whose only baseline callers called an interface or abstract member it implemented (find_usages' viaContract) is 'indeterminate' too: such a call ran its body only when the instance was of its type, and the reason says whether that credit was exact. Unsupported claim types return indeterminate.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `baselineSessionId` | string | yes | The baseline session_id (before the change). |
| `changedSessionId` | string | yes | The changed session_id (after the change). |
| `claimType` | string | yes | Claim type: 'no_new_api' or 'symbol_removed_unused'. |
| `symbol` | string \| null |  | The symbol name the claim is about (required for symbol_removed_unused) - a bare name or the qualified Type.Member form, the same strings find_usages / impact_of_change / find_tests_for resolve. A removed type whose simple name is ambiguous solution-wide is recorded under its FULL name; pass that full name for it. A namespace-qualified TYPE name is accepted here even when nothing was removed - this tool resolves it against the baseline's declared type identities, which the fan-in tools (simple name only) do not, and the answer then names the simple name to carry on with. A dotted name no namespace declares stays unresolved rather than falling back to whatever type carries its last segment. |
